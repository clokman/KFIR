title     = "Resilient Memories: Amerindian Cognitive Schemas in Latin American Art",
abstract  = "This book takes a cognitive approach to the mediation ofcollective memory by works of art. In looking at cultural productionof Amerindians--the transnational mnemonic community comprisedof indigenas, originarios, mestizos, and cholos--the author arguesthat cultural memories and identity are not simply the sum totalof individuals' expressions of self, but that some cultural artifactsbecome privileged to inform the heart of the mnemonic community.The book seeks to identify a series of cognitive schemas as thefoundation of an Amerindian Cognitive Unconsciousness as a viablealternative to the Freudian Dynamic Unconscious. Art, then, servesto trigger the cognitive schemas embedded within the Amerindiancommunity and act as the mediator of collective memory.Exploring works ranging in popularity, from Alfonso Cuaron's Y TuMama Tambien to the paintings of Peruvian artists Claudia Coca andJorge Miyagui, and from Mexican Zapatistas to hip-hop, the authordetails the ways in which artists interact with the embodied memoryof the community but also assert their own place within it as crucial,furthering their audiences' understanding of and interaction withexisting cultural schemas. In this way, the book shows that memoriesmust serve the present or they will be forgotten.",

abstract  = "Attacks against network infrastructures can be detected by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Still reaction to these events are often limited by the lack of larger contextual information in which they occurred. In this paper we present CoreFlow, a framework for the correlation and enrichment of IDS data with network flow information. CoreFlow ingests data from the Bro IDS and augments this with flow data from the devices in the network. By doing this the network providers are able to reconstruct more precisely the route followed by the malicious flows. This enables them to devise tailored countermeasures, e.g. blocking close to the source of the attack. We tested the initial CoreFlow prototype in the ESnet network, using inputs from 3 Bro systems and more than 50 routers.",

title     = "Nightmare Envy and Other Stories: American Culture and European Reconstruction",
abstract  = "What has it meant to be an Americanist? What did it mean to be an Americanist through fascism, war, and occupation? Nightmare Envy and Other Stories is a study of Americanist writing and institutions in the 20th century. Four chapters trace four routes through the midcentury decades. The first is the hidden history of American Studies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The second is the strange career of 'national character' in anthropology. The third is a contest between military occupation and cultural diplomacy in Europe. The fourth is the emergence and fate of the 'American Renaissance,' as the scholar and literary critic F.O. Matthiessen carried a canon of radical literature across the Iron Curtain. Each chapter culminates in the postwar period, when the ruin of postwar Europe led writers and intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic to understand America in new ways. Many of our modern myths of the United States and Europe were formed in this moment. Some saw the United States assume the mantle of cultural redeemer. Others saw a stereotypical America, rich in civilization but poor in culture, overtake a stereotypical Europe, rich in culture and equally rich in disaster. Drawing on American and European archives, the book weaves cultural, intellectual, and diplomatic history, with portraits of Matthiessen, Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, David Riesman, Alfred Kazin, and Ralph Ellison. It excavates the history of the Salzburg Seminar in American Civilization, where displaced persons, former Nazis, budding Communists, and glad-handing Americans met on the common ground of American culture. Others found keys to their own contexts in American books, reading Moby-Dick in the ruins. Nightmare Envy and Other Stories chronicles American encounters with European disaster, European encounters with American fiction, and the chasms over which culture had to reach.",

title     = "Conflict, Memory and Material Culture: The Archaeology of the Contestado War in Brazil (1912-1916)",
abstract  = "The Contestado War occurred in the southern region of Brazil between 1912 and 1916, opposing the local population, known as sertaneja or cabocla, against the state and federal military forces. It was triggered by the construction of railroads and the expansion of commercial logging activity. These early capitalist enterprises threatened natural habitats and led to the imprisonment or displacement of local communities.The displaced population congregated in so called 'holy strongholds', new villages which were rigidly controlled by the church in remote or relatively inaccessible locations. In 3 years of terror from 1912 until the end of 1915, state and federal military forces attempted to systematically destroy these new settlements. It has been estimated that as many as 6,000 people died in the conflict, mostly local caboclos. After the war, public agents tried to resolve the territorial disputes in the States of Santa Catarina and Parana through a process of social engineering. Colonization companies were set up to attract European immigrants to settle the land. This process served to further marginalize the remaining local population, who had already been worn down by the years of conflict and disruption. The area remains one of the poorest and economically disadvantaged regions of southern Brazil to this day. We offer our reflections on this subject below, with an emphasis on the post-conflict history of the territory, and the ways in which a programme of public archaeology has been devised to explore and disseminate information about this painful past.",

However, the concept of fit remains 'questionably defined and often misunderstood. Yet it is one of the most widely used psychological constructs in industrial and work psychology.' (Kristof-Brown & Billsberry, 2013, p.1). Two books and several meta-analyses have given an overview of the key issues and latest developments in the area of fit (e.g., Kristof-Brown & Billsberry, 2013; Kristof-Brown, et al., 2005; Kristof-Brown & Guay, 2011; Ostroff & Judge, 2007). Ostroff and Judge's (2007) book included mainly American contributions, and a few years later, Kristof-Brown and Billsberry (2013) took a more international perspective. In this Special Issue on fit and misfit, we aim to bring work and organizational psychologists together to discuss recent developments and future research directions in the area with particular relevance to the European context.",

abstract  = "Firms increasingly use social network sites to reach out to customers and proactively intervene with observed consumer messages. Despite intentions to enhance customer satisfaction by extending customer service, sometimes these interventions are received negatively by consumers. We draw on privacy regulation theory to theorize how proactive customer service interventions with consumer messages on social network sites may evoke feelings of privacy infringement. Subsequently we use privacy calculus theory to propose how these perceptions of privacy infringement, together with the perceived usefulness of the intervention, in turn drive customer satisfaction. In two experiments, we find that feelings of privacy infringement associated with proactive interventions may explain why only reactive interventions enhance customer satisfaction. Moreover, we find that customer satisfaction can be modelled through the calculus of the perceived usefulness and feelings of privacy infringement associated with an intervention. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of privacy concerns on consumer behavior in the context of firm-consumer interactions on social network sites, extend the applicability of privacy calculus theory, and contribute to complaint and compliment management literature. To practitioners, our findings demonstrate that feelings of privacy are an element to consider when handling consumer messages on social media, but also that privacy concerns may be overcome if an intervention is perceived as useful enough.",

abstract  = "This paper examines the allure of ancient athletics by examining its disappearance in Late Antiquity. Focusing on the spectator experience at the athletic games, the paper argues that the elites of the ancient cities, on whose investments athletic education and competitions depended, started to look at athletic contests in new ways. They may still have imagined themselves as successful athletes during the excitement of the contest, but they stopped identifying the athletes on display as their peers. As athletics, and the competitive spirit connected to it, lost its role in the education of the lower layers of the ruling classes, many spectators no longer had personal experience with the different sports and were, therefore, no longer potential athletes themselves. The spectators moreover stopped associating athletics with moral virtues: striving for physical excellence gradually became regarded as a vain pursuit, contradictory to the Christian ideal of humility. The perception of the athletic competition gradually shifted from an exemplary 'contest' to an exciting, but potentially dangerous 'show'.",

These organizations represent diverse, complex, and frequently atypical contexts. We contend that these contexts are especially enthralling for accounting scholars given their performance measurement challenges, accountability to diverse sets of stakeholders, and the need to frequently balance and reconcile logics of efficiency and effectiveness. To support our contentions, we unpack a number of distinct control and accountability-related themes underlying the four papers included in this Special Issue. We reflect on how these themes offer future empirical and theoretical research directions for accounting and accountability research in the realm of NGO/non-profit organizations and in organizations more generally.",

abstract = "Deep models are the defacto standard in visual decision problems due to their impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. On the other hand, their opaqueness has led to a surge of interest in explainable systems. In this work, we emphasize the importance of model explanation in various forms such as visual pointing and textual justification. The lack of data with justification annotations is one of the bottlenecks of generating multimodal explanations. Thus, we propose two large-scale datasets with annotations that visually and textually justify a classification decision for various activities, i.e. ACT-X, and for question answering, i.e. VQA-X. We also introduce a multimodal methodology for generating visual and textual explanations simultaneously. We quantitatively show that training with the textual explanations not only yields better textual justification models, but also models that better localize the evidence that support their decision.",

In this paper, a new model is proposed for generating explanations by utilizing localized grounding of constituent phrases in generated explanations to ensure image relevance. Specifically, we introduce a phrase-critic model to refine (re-score/re-rank) generated candidate explanations and employ a relative-attribute inspired ranking loss using 'flipped' phrases as negative examples for training. At test time, our phrase-critic model takes an image and a candidate explanation as input and outputs a score indicating how well the candidate explanation is grounded in the image.",

User acceptance is likely to benefit from easy-to-interpret visual and textual driving rationales which allow end-users to understand what triggered a particular behavior. Our approach involves two stages. In the first stage, we use visual (spatial) attention model to train a convolutional network end-to-end from images to steering angle commands. The attention model identifies image regions that potentially influence the network's output. We then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions causally influence the vehicle's control signal. In the second stage, we use a video-to-text language model to produce textual rationales that justify the model's decision. The explanation generator uses a spatiotemporal attention mechanism, which is encouraged to match the controller's attention.",

This work was performed in a tropical country of Central America, Costa Rica, with the aim of extending this knowledge to new world regions. This work is the first to report wastewater-based epidemiological data on the use of illicit drugs in this region of the world. Composite wastewater samples from the influents of two different wastewater treatment facilities and surface water samples from surrounding areas were collected applying the best practice protocol and analysed to investigate the occurrence and fate of selected illicit drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Results showed the presence of chemical indicators of the classic drugs cocaine and cannabis at high concentration levels, besides the moderate presence of the opiates codeine and morphine. Neither the worldwide commonly used psychoactive substances of abuse such as synthetic phenethylamines, nor pharmaceuticals from the family of benzodiazepines were detected, demonstrating the spatial differences in drug use among different world regions. In addition, effluent wastewater samples were analysed and compared to influent concentrations in order to evaluate the decrease in concentration of the targeted analytes through two treatment technologies. As a final step, a wide-scope qualitative screening, including hundreds of suspect compounds, was applied in order to have a better knowledge on the presence of pharmaceuticals in waters and to assess the potential impact of the treated wastewater into the receiving aquatic ecosystems.",

Receiving countries usually distribute the newly arriving asylum seekers across the entire country, in particular for small remote communities. Incidental opposition actions by local residents against the siting of Asylum Seeker Centres (ASC) has created the perception of strong and widespread resistance in the public sphere. This article aims to assess this alleged backlash by examining attitudes toward asylum seekers in small local communities. Using data from three representative surveys conducted among residents in the vicinity of four ASCs in the Netherlands, the regression analysis shows a strikingly high willingness to host an ASC, in opposition to popularly assumed public opinion.",

abstract  = "Counselor competence in telephone Motivation Interviewing (MI) to change lifestyle behaviors in a primary care population was assessed using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) rating system. Counselor behavior was evaluated by trained raters. Twenty minutes of a random sample of 336 MI sessions were coded representing 232 counselees. Ninety-four sessions (28%) were double coded to assess inter-rater agreement. The MI fidelity was examined by comparing the MI fidelity scores direction, empathy, spirit, % open questions, % complex reflections, reflections-to-questions ratio, % MI-adherent responses with the matching beginner proficiency MITI threshold.The inter-rater agreements for the MI fidelity summary scores were good (spirit, reflections-to-questions ratio), fair (empathy, % open questions, % MI-adherent responses) or poor (direction, % complex reflection). The MI fidelity scores for direction, empathy, spirit and the percentage of complex reflections exceeded the MITI threshold, but lower scores were found for the percentage of open questions, the reflections-to-questions ratio and the percentage of MI-adherent responses.In conclusion, evidence that MI was implemented was revealed. However, the inter-rater agreements scores and some fidelity scores leave room for improvement indicating that raters and counselors may need more ongoing training and feedback to achieve and maintain adequate competence. These findings apply to more complex skills (as rating complex reflections) in particular.",

Two explanations for these differences have been developed so far. The first posits that distinct lobbying styles reflect different political cultures. The second attributes distinct lobbying styles to variation in the institutional context in which lobbyists operate. Studies that have analysed lobbying within the US and Europe and assessed the relative importance of these arguments are problematic because both explanations are consistent with observed differences in lobbying style. In this article, we circumvent problems of observational equivalence by focussing on European and American lobbyists who are active in a similar institutional venue - that is, international diplomatic conferences. Relying on evidence collected at World Trade Organization Ministerial Conferences and United Nation Climate Summits, we tested the relevance of alternative explanations for the variation in lobbying styles between European and American lobbyists.

abstract  = "Boys engage in notably higher levels of resistance to schooling than girls. While scholars argue that peer processes contribute to this gender gap, this claim has not been tested with longitudinal quantitative data. This study fills this lacuna by examining the role of dynamic peer-selection and influence processes in the gender gap in resistance to schooling (i.e., arguing with teachers, skipping class, not putting effort into school, receiving punishments at school, and coming late to class) with two-wave panel data. We expect that, compared to girls, boys are more exposed and more responsive to peers who exhibit resistant behavior. We estimate hybrid models on 5448 students from 251 school classes in Sweden (14-15 years, 49% boys), and stochastic actor-based models (SIENA) on a subsample of these data (2480 students in 98 classes; 49% boys). We find that boys are more exposed to resistant friends than girls, and that adolescents are influenced by the resistant behavior of friends. These peer processes do not contribute to a widening of the gender gap in resistance to schooling, yet they contribute somewhat to the persistence of the initial gender gap. Boys are not more responsive to the resistant behavior of friends than girls. Instead, girls are influenced more by the resistant behavior of lower status friends than boys. This explains to some extent why boys increase their resistance to schooling more over time. All in all, peer-influence and selection processes seem to play a minor role in gender differences in resistance to schooling. These findings nuance under investigated claims that have been made in the literature.",

Moreover, low income attenuates the association between personality traits and economic ideology. I report a weaker association between Agreeableness and economic ideology among poor people compared to wealthier people in all three countries. Low income also attenuates the association between economic ideology and the traits Openness (Denmark), Extraversion (U.K.) and Neuroticism (U.S.).

abstract  = "The trophic structure of species communities depends on the energy transfer between trophic levels. Primary productivity varies strongly through time, challenging the persistence of species at higher trophic levels. Yet resource variability has mostly been studied in systems with only one or two trophic levels. We test the effect of variability in resource productivity in a tritrophic model system including a resource, a size-structured consumer, and a size-specific predator. The model complies with fundamental principles of mass conservation and the body-size dependence of individual-level energetics and predator-prey interactions. Surprisingly, we find that resource variability may promote predator persistence. The positive effect of variability on the predator arises through periods with starvation mortality of juvenile prey, which reduces the intraspecific competition in the prey population. With increasing variability in productivity and starvation mortality in the juvenile prey, the prey availability increases in the size range preferred by the predator. The positive effect of prey mortality on the trophic transfer efficiency depends on the biologically realistic consideration of body size-dependent and food-dependent functions for growth and reproduction in our model. Our findings show that variability may promote the trophic transfer efficiency, indicating that environmental variability may sustain species at higher trophic levels in natural ecosystems.",

abstract  = "The World Health Organization estimates that globally 2.4 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In nearly 30% of these cases, epilepsy cannot be properly controlled by antiepileptic drugs. More importantly, treatments to prevent or modify epileptogenesis do not exist. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed. In this respect, it is important to identify which patients will develop epilepsy and which individually tailored treatment is needed. However, currently, we have no tools to identify the patients at risk, and diagnosis of epileptogenesis remains as a major unmet medical need, which relates to lack of diagnostic biomarkers for epileptogenesis. As the epileptogenic process in humans is typically slow, the use of animal models is justified to speed up biomarker discovery. We aim to summarize recommendations for molecular biomarker research and propose a standardized procedure for biomarker discovery in rat models of epileptogenesis. The potential of many phylogenetically conserved circulating noncoding small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), as biomarkers has been explored in various brain diseases, including epilepsy. Recent studies show the feasibility of detecting miRNAs in blood in both experimental models and human epilepsy. However, the analysis of circulating miRNAs in rodent models is challenging, which relates both to the lack of standardized sampling protocols and to analysis of miRNAs. We will discuss the issues critical for preclinical plasma biomarker discovery, such as documentation, blood and brain tissue sampling and collection, plasma separation and storage, RNA extraction, quality control, and RNA detection. We propose a protocol for standardization of procedures for discovery of circulating miRNA biomarkers in rat models of epileptogenesis. Ultimately, we hope that the preclinical standardization will facilitate clinical biomarker discovery for epileptogenesis in man.",

We challenge this dual-route model and argue that attempts to provide clear-cut and straightforward criteria to distinguish between intentional and automatic action have systematically failed. Specifically, we show that there is no evidence for intention-independent action, and that attempts to use the criterion of reward sensitivity and rationality to differentiate between intentional and automatic action are conceptually unsound. As a more parsimonious, and more feasible, alternative we suggest a unitary approach to action control, according to which actions are (i) represented by codes of their perceptual effects, (ii) selected by matching intention-sensitive selection criteria, and (ii) moderated by metacontrol states.",

abstract  = "The question of linking human rights and peacebuilding has been on the academic, policy and practitioner agenda for a considerable time after initially coming to the fore in the 1990s. In recent years, it has gained further impetus following recognition in multiple policy documents that human rights, peace and development are closely related, and that practical efforts should build on such linkages. A certain blurring of boundaries between these domains in practice can indeed be observed. Yet experiences to date indicate that linking human rights and peacebuilding effectively is often easier said than done, in part because endeavours in the two realms can both complement and contradict one another. Serving as the introduction to a Special Issue of the Journal of Human Rights Practice on human rights and peacebuilding, this article discusses such developments, outlining the broader context in which the discussion on human rights and peacebuilding takes place and the importance of engaging with discourses and policies related to statebuilding and development assistance. These shape the conceptualization and implementation of human rights and peacebuilding separately and in relation to one another, both globally and in specific country settings, but to date they have seldom been explicitly considered in relation to the human rights/peacebuilding interface. The article further clarifies the use of the key concepts and discusses three implications of the close relationship between human rights violations and violent conflict, thereby setting the stage for a collection of articles and policy and practice notes on the relationship between human rights and peacebuilding.",

Over the past two decades, social and political debates have grown increasingly critical of 'multiculturalism', which is blamed for the loss of social cohesion and national identities. Therefore, national governments have shifted towards restrictive integration regimes whereby immigrants are required to adapt to the putative national culture. While studies of migration governance have traditionally focused on the national level, there is increasing interest in how local governments--who are most directly confronted with migration-related issues--view integration. New concepts used by city governments, such as diversity or interculturalism, would indicate a departure from assimilatory national rhetoric and/or policy, but their meaning and application remain unclear. Through a comparison of three European cities--Amsterdam, Stockholm and Vienna--we seek to understand the different uses of these concepts and relate them to the specific urban and national context.",

Tracing policy developments in Eastern Europe from the beginning of 2000s, when domestic violence first emerged on policy agendas, until 2015, Andrea Krizsan and Conny Roggeband look into the contestation that takes place between women's movements, states and actors opposing gender equality to explain the differences in gender equality sensitive policy outputs across the region.They point to regionally specific patterns of feminist engagement with the state in which coalition-building between women's organizations and establishing alliances with different state actors were critical for achieving gendered policy progress.

Fifteen-year-old Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents (N = 167) completed self-reports and played the online computer game. The game indeed elicited frustration, with increased self-reported anger. Moreover, expressions of displeasure were much more common during and after provocation than before provocation. Crucially, perceived self-evaluation mattered; higher levels of sense of coherence but lower levels of self-esteem (only in Moroccan-Dutch group) contributed to fewer expressions of displeasure. Gender did not play a moderating role. Our findings provide initial insights into individual differences in adolescents' responses in an online peer-conflict situation.",

Participants were 452 Dutch students who completed weekly maze measures over a period of 23 weeks. Criterion measures were school level, dyslexia status, scores and growth on a standardized reading test. Results supported the technical adequacy of maze scores as indicators of reading level and growth. Alternate-form reliability coefficients were significant and intermediate to high. Mean maze scores showed significant increase over time, students' growth trajectories differed, and students' initial performance levels (intercepts) and growth rates (slopes) were not correlated. Maze reading level and growth were related to reading level and/or growth on criterion measures. A nonlinear model provided a better fit for the data than a linear model. Implications for use of CBM maze-scores for data-based decision-making are discussed.",

abstract  = "This study investigates the reciprocal relationships between the fluctuation of the closing prices of three companies listed on the Amsterdam exchange index, namely ING, Philips and Shell and online media coverage related to these firms for a period of two years (2014-2015). Automated content analysis methods were employed to analyze sentiment and emotionality and to identify corporate topics related to the companies. A positive relation of the amount of coverage and emotionality with the fluctuation of stock prices was detected for Shell and Philips. In addition, corporate topics were found to positively Granger cause stock price fluctuation, particularly for Philips. The study advances past research in showing that the prediction of stock price fluctuation based on media coverage can be improved by including sentiment, emotionality, and corporate topics. The findings inform strategic communication, and particularly investor relations, in suggesting that media attention, sentiment, and certain corporate topics are crucial when managing media relations and with regard to securing a fair evaluation of listed companies. Furthermore, the innovative research methods are useful for researchers and practitioners alike in showcasing how media coverage related to firms and their stock fluctuations can be identified and analyzed in a reproducible, hands-on and efficient manner.",

title     = "Evaluating the environmental impact of debit card payments",
abstract  = "PurposeConsumers in the Netherlands made more than 3.2 billion debit card transactions at points-of-sale in 2015, corresponding to over half of all point-of-sale payments in that year. This study provides insights into the environmental impact of debit card transactions based on a life cycle assessment (LCA). In addition, it identifies several areas within the debit card payment chain where the environmental impact can be reduced.MethodsThe debit card payment system can be divided into three subsystems: debit cards, payment terminals, and data centers used for transaction processing. Input data for all elements within each subsystem (manufacturing, transport, energy use, and disposal) were retrieved from interviews and literature study. Seven key companies and authorities within the debit card system such as the Dutch Payments Association, two banks, two data centers, one payment terminal producer and a recycling company contributed data. The analysis is conducted using SimaPro, the Ecoinvent 3.0 database and the ReCiPe endpoint (H) impact assessment method.Results and discussionOne Dutch debit card transaction in 2015 is estimated to have an absolute environmental impact of 470 mPt. Within the process chain of a debit card transaction, the relative environmental impact of payment terminals is dominant, contributing 75% of the total impact. Terminal materials (37%) and terminal energy use (27%) are the largest contributors to this share, while the remaining impact comprises data center (11%) and debit card (15%) subsystems. For data centers, this impact mainly stems from their energy use. Finally, scenario analyses show that a significant decrease (44%) in the environmental impact of the entire debit card payment system could be achieved by stimulating the use of renewable energy in payment terminals and data centers, reducing the standby time of payment terminals and increasing the lifetimes of debit cards.ConclusionsFor the first time, the environmental consequences of electronic card payment systems are evaluated. The total environmental impact of debit card transactions in the Netherlands is relatively modest compared to the impact of cash payments, which are the closest substitute of debit card payments at the point-of-sale. Scenario analysis indicates that the environmental impact can be reduced by 44%.",

It sounds unserious and even stupid to base your fieldwork on chance.

That is not to say that we didn't ceaselessly try to get access by all kinds of formal and informal means. It simply means that without that breakthrough, which was largely a matter of chance, a stroke of good luck, often in the form of an unexpected face-to-face interaction, we would have probably not made it.

abstract = "Subject of this paper is a medieval Irish powerful text for healing eyes. It is extant in two versions: it is part of a narrative context in the Middle-Irish Birth and Life of Saint Moling and it fills a blank space in a medical manuscript, and thus presumably represents a cure used in daily life. The charm refers to the healing capacities of supernatural entities, words and matter. Interestingly, among the last category, we find the saliva of God and of Mary. Reading 'God' as a reference to Jesus, we note that in the history of relics, those from Jesus and his mother are most sacred. Although mention has been made of Jesus's baby teeth, blood, tears and breath and of Mary's milk and hair, any trace of their saliva appears to be absent. The historiolae about Jesus's healing saliva in the New-Testament Gospels are therefore probably crucial to the understanding of the charm, but what about Mary?This paper will present a close reading of these two versions and demonstrate that concepts central in them have predecessors in ancient Near-Eastern religions, and that motifs stem from biblical and apocryphal Near-Eastern and Mediterranean texts. Special attention will be given to traditions about Saint Philip in Greek and Latin. I will tentatively suggest that this charm supplies a new clue for knowledge of traditions about this apostle in medieval Ireland.",

The database used for the meta-analysis is accessible online and open to updates (Community-Augmented Meta-Analysis), which facilitates the accumulation and evaluation of previous and future studies on statistical learning in this domain. Method A systematic literature search identified 10 unique experiments examining auditory verbal statistical learning in 213 participants with SLI and 363 without SLI, aged between 6 and 19 years. Data from qualifying studies were extracted and converted to Hedges' g effect sizes. Results The overall standardized mean difference between participants with SLI and participants without SLI was 0.54, which was significantly different from 0 (p -- .001, 95% confidence interval [0.36, 0.71]). Conclusion Together, the results of our meta-analysis indicate a robust difference between people with SLI and people without SLI in their detection of statistical regularities in the auditory input. The detection of statistical regularities is, on average, not as effective in people with SLI compared with people without SLI. The results of this meta-analysis are congruent with a statistical learning deficit hypothesis in SLI.",

In a previous paper, we provide detailed microscopic expressions for these intrinsic rates [A. Vijaykumar, P. G. Bolhuis, and P. R. ten Wolde, Faraday Discuss. 195, 421 (2016)], which are usually considered as abstract quantities and assumed to be implicitly known. Using these microscopic expressions, we investigate how the rate of association depends on the strength and the range of the isotropic potential and the strength of the non- specific attraction in case of the anisotropic potential. In addition, we determine the location of the interface where these expressions become valid for anisotropic potentials. In particular, by investigating the particles' orientational distributions, we verify whether the interface at which these distributions become isotropic agrees with the interface predicted by the effective association rate constant. Finally, we discuss how large the intrinsic association rate can become, and what are the consequences for the existence of the diffusion limited regime. Published by AIP Publishing.",

abstract  = "Physically healthy, adult, same-sexed twins (n = 287) from a population-based twin cohort underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify fronto-limbic brain regions significantly associated with lifetime history of aggression. MRI scans used a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence, for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and history of aggressive behavior was assessed using the Life History of Aggression measure. Aggression had modest, inverse associations with grey matter volume (GMV) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, b = -0.20, se = 0.05, p -- 0.001) and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC, b = -0.23, se = 0.06, p -- 0.001). These associations were not confounded by other demographic, psychiatric, or personality factors. Biometrical twin analyses revealed significant heritabilities of 0.57 for GMV in the mPFC cluster and 0.36 for GMV in the lPFC cluster. Genetic factors accounted for the majority of the phenotypic correlations between aggression and mPFC GMV (85.3%) and between aggression and lPFC GMV (63.7%). Reduced GMV of prefrontal brain regions may be a neuronal characteristic of individuals with substantial histories of aggressive behavior regardless of psychiatric diagnosis. As such, these data suggest an anatomical correlate, with a possible genetic etiology, associated with functional deficits in social-emotional information processing.",

abstract  = "Conflicts and contention increasingly challenge the capacity to govern the city. Social conflicts are not only problematic but also reveal a sense of active citizenship and engagement. Agonistic theories argue that governments should embrace contention to improve democracy, but this notion has rarely been made tangible in a framework of analysis. This paper proposes the 'social-spatial narrative' (SSN) framework to analyze if, when, where, and how conflicts can create opportunities to strengthen urban democracy. The SSN framework analyzes the social geography and political significance of street-level encounters in processes of urban conflict. It unravels exactly how the micropolitics of citizenship interacts with policy practices at the street-level. Narratives reveal the perspectives of stakeholders, but in order to study how some actors establish power and others get excluded, I argue for a social-spatial approach to critical moments. Critical moments may create liminal moments to (re)negotiate meaning, relationships and repertoires of action. The potential of conflict lies in the dramaturgy of these critical moments, which are therefore pivotal vantage points for critical reflection on the repertoire of urban politics. The paper coalesces theories from conflict studies, geography, and public policy to examine conflict empirically through case studies. I illustrate the framework with a case study in Amsterdam that addresses when and where opportunities to engage plural voices in decision making have emerged, and how local officials have missed these opportunities.",

title     = "<< Avec Lipse dans la tourmente : Louis du Gardin traducteur de la Diva Virgo Hallensis >>",
abstract  = "The acts and writings of Louis du Gardin (1572-1633), town physician of Douay and professor of medicine at its Catholic University founded in 1560 by King Philip II of Spain, are considered in the context of what is called nowadays the process of 'confessionalisation'. Like Saint-Omer, Lille, Valenciennes, Arras and Cambray, the city of Douay, now in the North of France, belonged to the Southern Netherlands under Habsburg rule. The archduchess Isabel, daughter of Philip II, and her spouse Albert, once a cardinal, governed the Netherlands in a spirit true to the decrees of the Council of Trent. The first official publication of Du Gardin is considered in the perspective of the religious politics of Isabel and Albert. This modest publication, dedicated to both, is a translation of the first of Justus Lipsius' writings in praise of the Virgin Mary. Lipsius, one of the leading humanists of his time, had caused a scandal in the protestant world by leaving the University of Leyden in Holland, founded by William the Silent, leader of the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, and by accepting a chair at the University of Louvain in the Southern Netherlands, where he entered in close contact with major Jesuit scholars and became a mouthpiece of archducal politics. By translating Lipsius' booklet in praise of the Virgin of Hal, Du Gardin expressed his allegiance to these politics. He was proud to be a former student of J. Viringus, a pious professor of medicine at the University of Louvain, who in later life took religious orders and became a canon of the Notre-Dame cathedral of Arras; in this capacity, he served as a priest at the archducal court. As all his later writings show, Du Gardin became, like his teacher, an ardent promotor of Counter-Reformation ideals. Of special interest is his engagement in the cultural life of the city of Douay, where he spent the rest of his life. As a university professor, he was a prominent member of the small urban society he chose to live in. In many ways he voiced his adherence to Roman Catholic orthodoxy. As a physician, he published his ideas about the exact moment the soul entered the body of a newly born child. As a poet in the city's leading artistic society, he helped organising a yearly contest of religious poetry. Thus, in all his words and deeds he expressed those convictions he already so strongly adhered to in his rendering in everyday French of Lipsius' lofty praise of the Diva Virgo Hallensis.",

abstract    = "In het debat over de toekomst van de welvaartsstaat zijn verwijzingen naar globalisering, digitalisering en europeanisering prominent aanwezig. De indruk bestaat dat we de speelbal zijn van internationale krachten die niet alleen verantwoordelijk zijn voor groeiende ongelijkheid, maar ook de beleidsmarges van individuele landen aanzienlijk beperken. Belgie en Nederland zijn kleine, zeer open economieen: men zou verwachten dat die nog meer dan anderen de impact van globalisering ondergaan. Dat blijkt niet. We zien groeiende ongelijkheden, maar minder dan in heel wat andere landen. Al bij al houdt de middenklasse er relatief goed stand. Europese integratie en globalisering beletten ook niet dat het sociale bestel van Belgie en Nederland zeer verschillend blijft. De vaststelling is niet nieuw: in het verleden is al geopperd dat kleine staten over een sterk aanpassingsvermogen beschikken precies omdat ze hun kleine schaal combineren met een intens overleg tussen sociaaleconomische actoren. Betrokkenheid van werkgevers en vakbonden bij het beleid bevordert niet alleen een goede uitvoering van het beleid; als er de bereidheid is om samen te leren uit ervaringen, dan kan overleg ook de basis vormen voor flexibel aanpassingsvermogen. Het Nederlandse 'Poldermodel' is in het verleden vaak geroemd als een voorbeeld bij uitstek van deze kwaliteiten.In deze lezing wijs ik op verschillen, maar ook op gemeenschappelijke tendensen. We kunnen daaruit leren. Ik illustreer dit met een thema: de evolutie van armoede. Dit thema leidt naar een bredere vraag over het Nederlandse en het Belgische groeimodel en de rol van het overleg daarin. Ik put dat onderwerp niet uit, maar het vormt een opstap naar een kritische beschouwing over de visie die Belgie en Nederland hebben op hun positie in de Europese Unie. Deze is in toenemende mate defensief geworden. Europese politiek en binnenlandse sociale politiek hebben meer raakvlakken dan men wel zou denken. Een defensieve koers ten aanzien van de Europese Unie is geen veilige koers, maar op termijn een riskante koers. Kleine welvaartsstaten kunnen succesvol zijn in de Europese Unie, maar ze mogen niet 'klein' zijn in hun visie op de Europese Unie.https://doi.org/10.13140/rg.2.2.14550.34888",

Despite the depiction of existing societal issues connected to processes of social exclusion, the films primarily focus on the criminal culture connected to gang-related issues and urban violence, in which crime becomes contextualized, resulting in the dehumanisation of favelas and therefore reinforcing existing stereotypes. The study furthermore investigates what the de facto impact of these social constructions are on the perceptions about favelas on a local and global scale.",

abstract  = "ObjectiveCertain exercise prescriptions for patients with cancer may improve self-reported quality of life (QoL) and self-reported physical function (PF). We investigated the effects of exercise on QoL and PF in patients with cancer and studied differences in effects between different intervention-related and exercise-related characteristics.DesignWe searched four electronic databases to identify randomised controlled trials investigating exercise effects on QoL and PF in patients with cancer. Pooled effects (Hedges' g) were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on intervention dimensions, including timing, duration and delivery mode, and exercise dimensions, including frequency, intensity, type and time (FITT factors).ResultsWe included 74 exercise arms. Patients who were randomised to exercise interventions had significantly improved QoL (g=0.15, 95% CI (0.10 to 0.20), n=67 exercise arms) and PF (g=0.21, 95% CI (0.15 to 0.27), n=59 exercise arms) compared with patients in control groups. We found a significant between-group difference for exercise delivery mode, with significant beneficial effects for supervised exercise interventions (g=0.20, 95% CI (0.14 to 0.26) for QoL and g=0.27, 95% CI (0.20 to 0.33) for PF), but not for unsupervised interventions (g=0.04, 95% CI (-0.06 to 0.13) for QoL and g=0.09, 95% CI (-0.01 to 0.19) for PF). No statistically significant differences in intervention effects were found for variations in intervention timing, duration or exercise FITT factors. Unsupervised exercise with higher weekly energy expenditure was more effective than unsupervised exercise with lower energy expenditure (z=2.34, p=0.02).Conclusions Exercise interventions, especially when supervised, have statistically significant and small clinical benefit on self-reported QoL and PF in patients with cancer. Unsupervised exercise intervention effects on PF were larger when prescribed at a higher weekly energy expenditure.",

abstract  = "This paper scrutinizes current processes of urban fragmentation, segregation, and exclusion that result from the increasing flows of capital in gated communities, walled-off condominiums, and similar exclusivist investment hubs in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Gated community-like developments are growing and spreading into new areas. Although not all of the walled projects offer all-inclusiveness, they are unanimously based on the pre-selection of specific categories of residents. Moreover, all-inclusive urban developments are taking on new and more encompassing forms, such as 'gated cities'. Hence, socio-spatial inclusion and exclusion in the urban built environment are continuously transforming under the influence of investment capital (i.e., new urban investment flows and speculation), urbanistic concepts (e.g., different interpretations of safety and crime), and human mobilities. This paper builds on a comparison of empirical cases from Latin America and Africa to develop a qualitative framework of segregation indicators. In Latin America, gated communities have a long history, but exclusionary developments are changing in form, as well as in implications. In Africa, research on gated communities has particularly focused on South Africa (where they have a longer history), but exclusionary developments are spreading rapidly across the continent, and will influence future real estate development and land markets. Based on such complementary experiences, this paper grapples with the question of how these new all-inclusive developments influence the possibilities of achieving inclusive and sustainable urban transitions, as advocated in Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) and the New Urban Agenda.",

With this article we aim to contribute to this research area by focusing on ethno-racial diversity in the Dutch literary field. Through in-depth interviews, we analyse how gatekeepers mobilise specific cultural repertoires and by doing so draw ethno-racial boundaries when discussing acquisition, assessing quality and positioning themselves in the literary field. We argue that literary publishers and other professionals (selectively) employ an 'old school' modernist repertoire that especially values the formal aspects of literary products, by which non-white writers and publishers concerned with diversity are often positioned in an identity politics framework. Their work is said to take in a less prestigious 'political'/'subjective' position rather than a 'literary'/'universal' one. As such, this paper informs on how gatekeepers' practices shape the position of non-white authors in the Dutch literary field.",

abstract  = "Amino acids are potential substrates to replace fossil feedstocks for the synthesis of nitriles via oxidative decarboxylation using vanadium chloroperoxidase (VCPO), H2O2 and bromide. Here the conversion of glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) was investigated. It was observed that these two chemically similar amino acids have strikingly different reactivity. In the presence of catalytic amounts of NaBr (0.1 equiv.), Glu was converted with high selectivity to 3-cyanopropanoic acid. In contrast, under the same reaction conditions Asp showed low conversion and selectivity towards the nitrile, 2-cyanoacetic acid (AspCN). It was shown that only by increasing the amount of NaBr present in the reaction mixture (from 0.1 to 2 equiv.), could the conversion of Asp be increased from 15% to 100% and its selectivity towards AspCN from 45% to 80 This contradicts the theoretical hypothesis that bromide is recycled during the reaction. NaBr concentration was found to have a major influence on reactivity, independent of ionic strength of the solution. NaBr is involved not only in the formation of the reactive Br+ species by VCPO, but also results in the formation of potential intermediates which influences reactivity. It was concluded that the difference in reactivity between Asp and Glu must be due to subtle differences in interand intramolecular interactions between the functionalities of the amino acids.",

Here, we report and investigate the surprising double activation of uranyl by an organic ligand, 3,4,3-LI(CAM), leading to the formation of a formal U6+ chelate in the gas-phase. The cleavage of both uranyl oxo bonds was experimentally evidenced by CID, using deuterium and O-18 isotopic substitutions, and by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) computations predict that the overall reaction requires only 132 kJ/mol, with the first oxygen activation entailing about 107 kJ/mol. Combined with analysis of similar, but unreactive ligands, these results shed light on the chelation-driven mechanism of uranyl oxo bond cleavage, demonstrating its dependence on the presence of ligand hydroxyl protons available for direct interactions with the uranyl oxygens.",

title     = "Words are Malleable: Computing Semantic Shi s in Political and Media Discourse",
abstract  = "Recently, researchers started to pay attention to the detection of temporal shifts in the meaning of words. However, most (if not all) of these approaches restricted their efforts to uncovering change over time, thus neglecting other valuable dimensions such as social or political variability. We propose an approach for detecting semantic shifts between different viewpoints--broadly defined as a set of texts that share a specific metadata feature, which can be a time-period, but also a social entity such as a political party. For each viewpoint, we learn a semantic space in which each word is represented as a low dimensional neural embedded vector. The challenge is to compare the meaning of a word in one space to its meaning in another space and measure the size of the semantic shifts. We compare the effectiveness of a measure based on optimal transformations between the two spaces with a measure based on the similarity of the neighbors of the word in the respective spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of these two performs best. We show that the semantic shifts not only occur over time, but also along different viewpoints in a short period of time. For evaluation, we demonstrate how this approach captures meaningful semantic shifts and can help improve other tasks such as the contrastive viewpoint summarization and ideology detection (measured as classification accuracy) in political texts. We also show that the two laws of semantic change which were empirically shown to hold for temporal shifts also hold for shifts across viewpoints. These laws state that frequent words are less likely to shift meaning while words with many senses are more likely to do so.",

The most important corrections include accounting for the solvent molecules' size, the destruction of the solid's crystal structure, and the specificity of hydrogen-bonding interactions, as well as opportunities to predict the solubility at extrapolated temperatures.

abstract  = "Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the dimensional accuracy, surface topography of a custom designed, 3D-printed zirconia dental implant and the mechanical properties of printed zirconia discs. Materials and methods A custom designed implant was 3D-printed in zirconia using digital light processing technique (DLP). The dimensional accuracy was assessed using the digital-subtraction technique. The mechanical properties were evaluated using biaxial flexure strength test. Three different build angles were adopted to print the specimens for the mechanical test; 0deg(Vertical), 45deg (Oblique) and 90deg(Horizontal) angles. The surface topography, crystallographic phase structure and surface roughness were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM), X-ray diffractometer and confocal microscopy respectively. Results The printed implant was dimensionally accurate with a root mean square (RMSE) value of 0.1 mm. The Weibull analysis revealed a statistically significant higher characteristic strength (1006.6 MPa) of 0deg printed specimens compared to the other two groups and no significant difference between 45deg (892.2 MPa) and 90deg (866.7 MPa) build angles. SEM analysis revealed cracks, micro-porosities and interconnected pores ranging in size from 196 nm to 3.3 um. The mean Ra (arithmetic mean roughness) value of 1.59 um (+-0.41) and Rq (root mean squared roughness) value of 1.94 um (+-0.47) was found. A crystallographic phase of primarily tetragonal zirconia typical of sintered Yttria tetragonal stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) was detected. Conclusions DLP prove to be efficient for printing customized zirconia dental implants with sufficient dimensional accuracy. The mechanical properties showed flexure strength close to those of conventionally produced ceramics. Optimization of the 3D-printing process parameters is still needed to improve the microstructure of the printed objects.",

abstract  = "Similar to many other anticancer therapies, photodynamic therapy (PDT) also suffers from the intrinsic cancer resistance mediated by cell survival pathways. These survival pathways are regulated by various proteins, among which anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 plays an important role in regulation of programmed cell death and has been proved to involve in protecting against oxidative stimuli. Confronted by this challenge, we propose and validate here a novel upconversion photosensitizing nanoplatform which enables significant reduction of cancer resistance and improve PDT efficacy. The upconversion nano-photosensitizer contains the photosensitizing molecules - Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and Bcl-2 inhibitor - ABT737 small molecules, denoted as ABT737@ZnPc-UCNPs. ABT737 molecules were encapsulated, in a pH sensitive way, into the nanoplatform through Poly (ethylene glycol)-Poly (L-histidine) diblock copolymers (PEG-b-PHis). This nanosystem exhibits the superiority of sensitizing tumor cells for PDT through adjuvant intervention strategy. Upon reaching to lysosomes, the acidic environment changes the solubility of PEG-b-PHis, resulting in the burst-release of ABT737 molecules which deplete the Bcl-2 level in tumor cells and leave the tumor cells out from the protection of anti-apoptotic survival pathway in advance. Owing to the sensitization effect of ABT737@ZnPc-UCNPs, the PDT therapeutic efficiency of cancer cells can be significantly potentiated in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

We argue that the widespread idea that what draws self-trackers to numerical data is its perceived power of truth and objectivity--a so-called 'data fetishism'--is limiting. Using an ethnographic approach, we describe three ways in which self-trackers attribute meaning to their data-gathering practices which escape this data fetishist critique: self-tracking as a practice of mindfulness, as a means of resistance against social norms, and as a communicative and narrative aid. In light of this active engagement with data, we suggest that it makes more sense to view these practitioners as 'quantifying selves.'

title     = "Radiation-induced changes in the microstructure of epithelial cells of the oral mucosa: A comparative light and electron microscopic study",
abstract  = "Objectives: The microplicae is a typical structure of the epithelial cell surface of the oral mucosa. The cell surface is potentially of great significance, as it provides the underlying basis for the protective function of the salivary pellicle. The aim of this study was to investigate whether radiation therapy affects the surface morphology of the superficial cells of the human oral mucosa in patients who have received radiotherapy for oral cancer. Material and methods: Oral mucosal tissue samples from 91 patients were collected during dental implant surgery or ablative surgery. Study group 1 consisted of 28 patients who underwent dental implant surgery after radiotherapy. Group 2 consisted of five patients who developed osteoradionecrosis. Group 3 consisted of eight oral cancer patients without radiotherapy. Group 4 consisted of 50 clinically healthy subjects as controls. The samples were studied with scanning electron microscopy and compared with both light and transmission electron micrographs. Results: Radiation therapy (RT) induces breakage and destruction in the microplicae morphology and declines the density of the microplicae surface structures. In some of the irradiated cells, the microplicae were completely vanished, especially in patients who developed osteoradionecrosis. In non-irradiated tissue, the microplicae of the superficial epithelial cells were intact in all cases. Conclusion: Scanning electron microscopy, in contrast to light microscopy, appears to be a useful tool to reveal the condition of superficial oral mucosal cells. In respect of the possible pathogenesis of osteoradionecrosis, the radiation-induced damage of the microplicae and its influence on the mucosal salivary pellicle is discussed.",

abstract  = "The focus of this study was to determine which chemokine receptors are present on oral fibroblasts and whether these receptors influence proliferation, migration, and/or the release of wound healing mediators. This information may provide insight into the superior wound healing characteristics of the oral mucosa. The gingiva fibroblasts expressed 12 different chemokine receptors (CCR3, CCR4, CCR6, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR7, CX3CR1, and XCR1), as analyzed by flow cytometry. Fourteen corresponding chemokines (CCL5, CCL15, CCL20, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27, CCL28, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL11, CXCL12, CXCL13, CX3CL1, and XCL1) were used to study the activation of these receptors on gingiva fibroblasts. Twelve of these fourteen chemokines stimulated gingiva fibroblast migration (all except for CXCL8 and CXCL12). Five of the chemokines stimulated proliferation (CCL5/CCR3, CCL15/CCR3, CCL22/CCR4, CCL28/CCR3/CCR10, and XCL1/XCR1). Furthermore, CCL28/CCR3/CCR10 and CCL22/CCR4 stimulation increased IL-6 secretion and CCL28/CCR3/CCR10 together with CCL27/CCR10 upregulated HGF secretion. Moreover, TIMP-1 secretion was reduced by CCL15/CCR3. In conclusion, this in-vitro study identifies chemokine receptor-ligand pairs which may be used in future targeted wound healing strategies. In particular, we identified the chemokine receptors CCR3 and CCR4, and the mucosa specific chemokine CCL28, as having an predominant role in oral wound healing by increasing human gingiva fibroblast proliferation, migration, and the secretion of IL-6 and HGF and reducing the secretion of TIMP-1.",

The associations between rejection sensitivity and depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder varied by type of sample, but the associations were similar for clinical and non-clinical (i.e., community) samples. The association between rejection sensitivity and anxiety was negatively moderated by percentage of females in samples.

abstract  = "Biological motion (BM) is one of the most important social cues for detecting conspecifics, prey, and predators. We show that unconscious BM processing can reflexively direct spatial attention, and that this effect has a biphasic temporal profile. Participants responded to probes that were preceded by intact or scrambled BM cues rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression. With a short inter-stimulus interval (ISI, 100ms) between the invisible BM cues and the probe, responses to probes at the same location as the invisible, nonpredictive BM cue were faster than to probes at the location of the scrambled BM cue. With a longer ISI (800ms) this effect reversed, with slower responses to probes at the location of the invisible, nonpredictive BM. These effects were absent when BM and its scrambled control were made visible with both short and long cue durations across variable length of ISIs, indicating that the saliency of BM itself cannot account for the dynamic orienting effects from invisible social cues. Moreover, this dynamic attentional shifts were specific to upright BM cues and not obtained for inverted stimuli. Thus, this reflexive and dynamic attentional modulation triggered by invisible BM, with initial facilitation followed by inhibition, demonstrates that in the complete absence of conscious awareness, cue predictiveness, and saliency differences, attentional systems promote exploration of our visual environment for social signals.",

abstract  = "The use of DNA methylation (DNAm) to obtain additional information in forensic investigations showed to be a promising and increasing field of interest. Prediction of the chronological age based on age-dependent changes in the DNAm of specific CpG sites within the genome is one such potential application. Here we present an age-prediction tool for whole blood based on massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and a random forest machine learning algorithm. MPS allows accurate DNAm determination of pre-selected markers and neighboring CpG-sites to identify the best age-predictive markers for the age-prediction tool. 15 age-dependent markers of different loci were initially chosen based on publicly available 450K microarray data, and 13 finally selected for the age tool based on MPS (DDO, ELOVL2, F5, GRM2, HOXC4, KLF14, LDB2, MEIS1-AS3, NKIRAS2, RPA2, SAMD10, TRIM59, ZYG11A). Whole blood samples of 208 individuals were used for training of the algorithm and a further 104 individuals were used for model evaluation (age 18-69). In the case of KLF14, LDB2, SAMD10, and GRM2, neighboring CpG sites and not the initial 450K sites were chosen for the final model. Cross-validation of the training set leads to a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 3.21 years and a root-mean square error (RMSE) of 3.97 years. Evaluation of model performance using the test set showed a comparable result (MAD 3.16 years, RMSE 3.93 years). A reduced model based on only the top 4 markers (ELOVL2, F5, KLF14, and TRIM59) resulted in a RMSE of 4.19 years and MAD of 3.24 years for the test set (cross validation training set: RMSE 4.63 years, MAD 3.64 years). The amplified region was additionally investigated for occurrence of SNPs in case of an aberrant DNAm result, which in some cases can be an indication for a deviation in DNAm. Our approach uncovered well-known DNAm age-dependent markers, as well as additional new age-dependent sites for improvement of the model, and allowed the creation of a reliable and accurate epigenetic tool for age-prediction without restriction to a linear change in DNAm with age.",

Data were used of a Dutch randomized controlled trial (N =229). First, the proportion of families willing to organize an FGc and actually completing a conference was determined. Then, for each of the phases, reasons for dropout according to parents, child welfare workers and FGC-coordinators were assessed and categorized and family characteristics were linked to completion rate. Results showed that 60% of the families (137 families) were willing to organize an FGc and 27% (62 families) eventually completed a conference. Reasons for dropout were lack of motivation,high-conflict divorce situations and need for other professional care. Broken and/or newly formed families were less likely to complete a conference, whereas families with indications for child maltreatment were more likely to complete a conference. Future research is needed to examine other possible explanations for the relatively low success rate, such as attitude of child welfare workers towards FGC and the lack of understanding of the aim of FGC by child welfare workers and families.",

This paper follows up on Assenza et al. (2013) by using a Genetic Algorithms (GA) model to replicate the results from their LtF experiment. In this GA model, individuals optimize an adaptive, a trend following and an anchor coefficient in a population of general prediction heuristics. We replicate experimental treatments in a New-Keynesian environment with increasing complexity and use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well the model explains the experimental data. We find that the evolutionary learning model is able to replicate the three different types of behavior, i.e. convergence to steady state, stable oscillations and dampened oscillations in the treatments using one GA model. Heterogeneous behavior can thus be explained by an adaptive, anchor and trend extrapolating component and the GA model can be used to explain heterogeneous behavior in LtF experiments with different types of complexity.",

Rates on the extent of information provided were calculated for each topic and relationships between client characteristics and dichotomous outcomes of the extent of information provided were assessed using Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling.Findingsour findings showed that women who did not take folic acid supplementation, who smoked, or had a partner who smoked, were usually provided basic and occasionally extensive explanations about these topics. The majority of clients were provided with no information on recommended weight gain (91.9%), fish promotion (90.8%), caffeine limitation (89.6%), vitamin D supplementation (87.3%), physical activity promotion (81.5%) and antenatal class attendance (75.7%) and only brief mention of alcohol (91.3%), smoking (81.5%), folic acid (58.4) and weight at the start of pregnancy (52.0%). The importance of a nutritious diet was generally either never mentioned (38.2%) or briefly mentioned (45.1%). Nulliparous women were typically given more information on most topics than multiparous women.Key conclusions and implications for practice:although additional information was generally provided about folic acid and smoking, when relevant for their clients, the majority of women were provided with little or no information about the other health behaviours examined in this study.

abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of machining on the flexural fatigue strength and on the surface roughness of different computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramics by comparing machined and polished after machining specimens.METHODS: Disc-shaped specimens of yttria-stabilized polycrystalline tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP), leucite-, and lithium disilicate-based glass ceramics were prepared by CAD/CAM machining, and divided into two groups: machining (M) and machining followed by polishing (MP). The surface roughness was measured and the flexural fatigue strength was evaluated by the step-test method (n=20). The initial load and the load increment for each ceramic material were based on a monotonic test (n=5). A maximum of 10,000 cycles was applied in each load step, at 1.4Hz. Weibull probability statistics was used for the analysis of the flexural fatigue strength, and Mann-Whitney test (a=5%) to compare roughness between the M and MP conditions.RESULTS: Machining resulted in lower values of characteristic flexural fatigue strength than machining followed by polishing. The greatest reduction in flexural fatigue strength from MP to M was observed for Y-TZP (40%; M=536.48MPa; MP=894.50MPa), followed by lithium disilicate (33%; M=187.71MPa; MP=278.93MPa) and leucite (29%; M=72.61MPa; MP=102.55MPa). Significantly higher values of roughness (Ra) were observed for M compared to MP (leucite: M=1.59mm and MP=0.08mm; lithium disilicate: M=1.84mm and MP=0.13mm; Y-TZP: M=1.79mm and MP=0.18mm).SIGNIFICANCE: Machining negatively affected the flexural fatigue strength of CAD/CAM ceramics, indicating that machining of partially or fully sintered ceramics is deleterious to fatigue strength.",

In recent times, a substantial number of so-called ''interactive' documentaries has seen the light of day. In this paper, one dimension of such online documentaries, namely the freedom of users to access content via different paths of navigation as well as to skip material, is discussed from the perspective that a documentary, in a necessarily subjective way, attempts to convince the viewer of something.

abstract  = "Children acquire the meaning of ook 'also' in Dutch relatively late (Bergsma 2006), although this focus particle is highly frequent. We argue that this late acquisition is caused by a pragmatic rule: contrastive implicature. We follow Saebo (2004), who argues that additives are used because without them, the sentences they appear in would be interpreted as contrastive in relation to the context. Data from a sentence completion task administered to Dutch L1 learners (N = 62, ages 4;0-5;11) show that, on average, four-year-olds do not distinguish sentences with ook from sentences without ook. Five-year-olds do better on sentences with ook but worse on sentences without it. We argue that they have generally acquired contrastive implicature: they apply the correct contrastive interpretation to sentences without ook, but overgeneralize this implicature to sentences with ook, before completely acquiring the meaning of ook.",

abstract  = "Plant pathogens employ effector proteins to manipulate their hosts. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), the causal agent of tomato wilt disease, produces effector protein Avr2. Besides being a virulence factor, Avr2 triggers immunity in I-2 carrying tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Fol strains that evade I-2 recognition carry point mutations in Avr2 (e.g. Avr2R45H), but retain full virulence. Here we investigate the virulence function of Avr2 and determine its crystal structure. Transgenic tomato and Arabidopsis expressing either wild-type DspAvr2 (deleted signal-peptide) or the DspAvr2R45H variant become hypersusceptible to fungal, and even bacterial infections, suggesting that Avr2 targets a conserved defense mechanism. Indeed, Avr2 transgenic plants are attenuated in immunity-related readouts, including flg22-induced growth inhibition, ROS production and callose deposition. The crystal structure of Avr2 reveals that the protein shares intriguing structural similarity to ToxA from the wheat pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and to TRAF proteins. The I-2 resistance-breaking Avr2V41M, Avr2R45H and Avr2R46P variants cluster on a surface-presented loop. Structure-guided mutagenesis enabled uncoupling of virulence from I-2-mediated recognition. We conclude that I-2-mediated recognition is not based on monitoring Avr2 virulence activity, which includes suppression of immune responses via an evolutionarily conserved effector target, but by recognition of a distinct epitope.",

Furthermore, we investigated whether the strength of these associations depended on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Our sample included 48 teachers and 179 kindergartners (94 boys; mean age=66.75 months) who were selected to represent a variation of externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Independent observers rated teachers' interpersonal behaviors and children's task behaviors. Teacher control was negatively related to both children's task engagement and performance, whereas teacher affiliation was not associated with children's task behaviors. Furthermore, associations between teachers' complementarity tendencies on control and children's task performance depended on the level of control that children displayed themselves. To conclude, teachers should be made aware that controlling behaviors could be detrimental for children's task behaviors.",

In line with earlier research, we found significant concurrent correlations between adolescents' SNS use and their social self-esteem in all three data waves. The longitudinal results only partly confirmed these concurrent findings: Adolescents' initial SNS use did not significantly influence their social self-esteem in subsequent years. In contrast, their initial social self-esteem consistently influenced their SNS use in subsequent years. The valence of online feedback from close friends and acquaintances explained the concurrent relationship between SNS use and social self-esteem, but not the longitudinalrelationship.

abstract  = "ObjectiveTo further test the validity and clinical usefulness of the steep ramp test (SRT) in estimating exercise tolerance in cancer survivors by external validation and extension of previously published prediction models for peak oxygen consumption (Vo2peak) and peak power output (Wpeak).DesignCross-sectional study.SettingMulticenter.ParticipantsCancer survivors (N=283) in 2 randomized controlled exercise trials.InterventionsNot applicable.Main Outcome MeasuresPrediction model accuracy was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and limits of agreement (LOA). Multiple linear regression was used for model extension. Clinical performance was judged by the percentage of accurate endurance exercise prescriptions.ResultsICCs of SRT-predicted Vo2peak and Wpeak with these values as obtained by the cardiopulmonary exercise test were .61 and .73, respectively, using the previously published prediction models. 95% LOA were +-705mL/min with a bias of 190mL/min for Vo2peak and +-59W with a bias of 5W for Wpeak. Modest improvements were obtained by adding body weight and sex to the regression equation for the prediction of Vo2peak (ICC, .73; 95% LOA, +-608mL/min) and by adding age, height, and sex for the prediction of Wpeak (ICC, .81; 95% LOA, +-48W). Accuracy of endurance exercise prescription improved from 57% accurate prescriptions to 68% accurate prescriptions with the new prediction model for Wpeak.ConclusionsPredictions of Vo2peak and Wpeak based on the SRT are adequate at the group level, but insufficiently accurate in individual patients. The multivariable prediction model for Wpeak can be used cautiously (eg, supplemented with a Borg score) to aid endurance exercise prescription.",

abstract  = "Cities have become stages for (inter)national conflicts over political and religious identity, democratic values and ownership of place. These 'glocal urban conflicts' challenge local actors to respond immediately and effectively in ways that prevent escalation and strengthen democratic relations. The theory of agonistic democracy provides a valuable model that celebrates difference and inclusiveness to foster democracy. There is, however, little understanding of how these agnostic ideals are practiced in rapidly unfolding situations. This article provides a case study to further our understanding of dealing with conflicts where global tensions are enacted at the street level. It proposes an interpretative approach that brings into focus how a decentred network of local professionals practice agnostic democracy in action. The local government of The Hague was challenged to 'govern the global locally' when young Muslims waved flags allying with ISIS on the streets of the Schilderswijk neighbourhood. A series of local demonstrations required appropriate responses in a highly mediatised conflict. The analysis provides three 'critical moments' that function as a lens to study governance practices that underscore diversity as a political resource. Practices of 'governing meaning' and 'governing the street' addressed concerns about security, ownership and local grievances.",

In most studies, methodological quality was low. It is likely that an inclusion bias exists, many studies only included exceptional speakers. Significant better outcomes are reported for TES compared to ES for the acoustic parameters, fundamental frequency, maximum phonation time and intensity. Perceptually, TES is rated with a significant better voice quality and intelligibility than ES and ELS. None of the speech rehabilitation groups reported clearly better outcomes in patient-reported outcomes.ConclusionsStudies on speech outcomes after TL are flawed in design and represent weak levels of evidence. There is an urge for standardized measurement tools for evaluations of substitute voice speakers. TES is the favorable speech rehabilitation method according to acoustic and perceptual outcomes. All speaker groups after TL report a degree of voice handicap. Knowledge of caretakers and differences in health care and insurance systems play a role in the speech rehabilitation options that can be offered.",

abstract  = "We investigate a Markovian tandem queueing model in which service to the first queue is provided in batches. The main goal is to choose the batch sizes so as to minimize a linear cost function of the mean queue lengths. This model can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for which the optimal strategy has nice structural properties. In principle we can numerically compute the optimal decision in each state, but doing so can be computationally very demanding. A previously obtained approximation is computationally efficient for low and moderate loads, but for high loads also suffers from long computation times. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the optimal strategy and develop heuristic policies motivated by the analysis of a related controlled fluid problem. The fluid approach provides excellent approximations, and thus understanding, of the optimal MDP policy. The computational effort to determine the heuristic policies is much lower and, more importantly, hardly affected by the system load. The heuristic approximations can be extended to models with general service distributions, for which we numerically illustrate the accuracy.",

title     = "Boosting the Supercapacitance of Nitrogen-Doped Carbon by Tuning Surface Functionalities",
abstract  = "The specific capacitance of a highly porous, nitrogen-doped carbon is nearly tripled by orthogonal optimization of the microstructure and surface chemistry. First, the carbons' hierarchical pore structure and specific surface area were tweaked by controlling the temperature and sequence of the thermal treatments. The best process (pyrolysis at 900 degrees C, washing, and subsequent annealing at 1000 degrees C) yielded a carbon with a specific capacitance of 117Fg(-1)nearly double that of a carbon made by a typical single-step synthesis at 700 degrees C. Following the structural optimization, the surface chemistry of the carbons was enriched by applying an oxidation routine based on a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid in a 1:4 ratio at two different treatment temperatures (0 and 20 degrees C) and different treatment times. The optimal treatment times were 4h at 0 degrees C and only 1h at 20 degrees C. Overall, the specific capacitance nearly tripled relative to the original carbon, reaching 168Fg(-1). The inherent nitrogen doping of the carbon comes into interplay with the acid-induced surface functionalization, creating a mixture of oxygen- and nitrogen-oxygen functionalities. The evolution of the surface chemistry was carefully followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and by N-2 sorption porosimetry, revealing stepwise surface functionalization and simultaneous carbon etching. Overall, these processes are responsible for the peak-shaped capacitance trends in the carbons.",

abstract  = "Petrochemical refineries must separate hydrocarbon mixtures on a large scale for the production of fuels and chemicals. Typically, these hydrocarbons are separated by distillation, which is extremely energy intensive. This high energy cost can be mitigated by developing materials that can enable efficient adsorptive separation. In this critical review, the principles of adsorptive separation are outlined, and then the case for C-4 separations by using zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is examined. By analyzing both experimental and theoretical studies, the challenges and opportunities in C-4 separation are outlined, with a focus on the separation mechanisms and structure-selectivity correlations. Zeolites are commonly used as adsorbents and, in some cases, can separate C-4 mixtures well. The pore sizes of eight-membered-ring zeolites, for example, are in the order of the kinetic diameters of C-4 isomers. Although zeolites have the advantage of a rigid and highly stable structure, this is often difficult to functionalize. MOFs are attractive candidates for hydrocarbon separation because their pores can be tailored to optimize the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. MOF-5 and ZIF-7 show promising results in separating all C-4 isomers, but breakthrough experiments under industrial conditions are needed to confirm these results. Moreover, the flexibility of the MOF structures could hamper their application under industrial conditions. Adsorptive separation is a promising viable alternative and it is likely to play an increasingly important role in tomorrow's refineries.",

It points out that, within discourses of post-democracy, aspects of depoliticisation are commonly assessed through theatrical concepts such as spectacle, play, game and theatre. At the same time, this work argues by an analysis of three performances, 'Wijksafari Utrecht' by Adelheid Roosen, a political protest by Quinsy Gario, and 'Labyrinth' by the refugee group 'We are Here Cooperative', that there might be a role for theatre in this age of depoliticisation. It proposes to scrutinise, based on the writings of Samuel Weber, a paradox of theatre. Namely, while concepts of theatre are applied to convey disapproval of government and politics, theatre has a possible emancipatory character to dispute the given order.",

abstract  = "The direct and efficient conversion of alcohols into amines is a pivotal transformation in chemistry. Here, we present an artificial, oxidation-reduction, biocatalytic network that employs five enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase, NADP-oxidase, catalase, amine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase) in two concurrent and orthogonal cycles. The NADP-dependent oxidative cycle converts a diverse range of aromatic and aliphatic alcohol substrates to the carbonyl compound intermediates, whereas the NAD-dependent reductive aminating cycle generates the related amine products with -- 99% enantiomeric excess (R) and up to -- 99% conversion. The elevated conversions stem from the favorable thermodynamic equilibrium (K'(eq) = 1.88 x 10(42) and 1.48 x 10(41) for the amination of primary and secondary alcohols, respectively). This biocatalytic network possesses elevated atom efficiency, since the reaction buffer (ammonium formate) is both the aminating agent and the source of reducing equivalents. Additionally, only dioxygen is needed, whereas water and carbonate are the by-products. For the oxidative step, we have employed three variants of the NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus and we have elucidated the origin of the stereoselective properties of these variants with the aid of in silico computational models.",

abstract  = "The association and dissociation of particles via specific anisotropic interactions is a fundamental process, both in biology (proteins) and in soft matter (colloidal patchy particles). The presence of alternative binding sites can lead to multiple productive states and also to non-productive ``decoy'' or intermediate states. Besides anisotropic interactions, particles can experience non-specific isotropic interactions. We employ single replica transition interface sampling to investigate how adding a non-productive binding site or a nonspecific isotropic interaction alters the dimerization kinetics of a generic patchy particle model. The addition of a decoy binding site reduces the association rate constant, independent of the site's position, while adding an isotropic interaction increases it due to an increased rebinding probability. Surprisingly, the association kinetics becomes non-monotonic for a tetramer complex formed by multivalent patchy particles. While seemingly identical to two-particle binding with a decoy state, the cooperativity of binding multiple particles leads to a kinetic optimum. Our results are relevant for the understanding and modeling of biochemical networks and self-assembly processes. Published by AIP Publishing.",

The design of cage L2 is based on the ligand-template approach, in which the ligand acts as a template for cage formation. Previously, first-generation cage L1, in which zinc(II) porphyrin units were utilized instead of porpholactones, was reported. Binding studies demonstrate that the association constant for the formation of second-generation cage L2 is nearly an order of magnitude higher than that of L1. This strengthened binding allows cage L2 to remain intact in polar and industrially relevant solvents. As a consequence, the unprecedented regioselectivity for branched aldehyde products can be maintained in polar and coordinating solvents by using the second-generation assembly.",

The IRMPD decomposition of the monocyclic ions proceeds principally via H-2 expulsion, although CAD experiments show additional pathways.

It challenges the thesis that the European Community was originally uninterested in the political nature of its members as long as they were non-communist and that the Community made a volte face in 1962 in reaction to a request for an association agreement by Franco's Spain.

However, patient tissues are uniquely obtained by time and location, and limited in their availability and size. Currently, little-knowledge exists about appropriate and simplified protocols for routine MS-based analysis of the various types and sizes of tissues. Following standard procedures used in pathology, we selected small fresh frozen uterine tissue samples to investigate how the tissue preparation protocol affected the subsequent proteomics analysis. First, we observed that protein extraction with 0.1% SDS followed by extraction with a 30% ACN/urea resulted in a decrease in the number of identified proteins, when compared to extraction with 30% ACN/urea only. The decrease in the number of proteins was approximately 556 and 20 for 10 and 16 mu m thick tissue, respectively. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the proteins shared between the two methods was higher when SDS/ACN/urea was used, compared to the 30% ACN/urea extraction, indicating the role of SDS to be beneficial for protein solubility. Second, the influence of tissue thickness was investigated by comparing the results obtained for 10, 16, and 20 mu m thick (1 min(2)) tissue using urea/30% ACN. We observed an increase in the number of identified proteins and corresponding quantity with an increase in the tissue thickness. Finally, by analyzing very small amounts of tissues (similar to 0.2 mm(2)) of 10, 16, and 20 mu m thickness, we observed that the increase in tissue thickness resulted in a higher number of protein identifications and corresponding quantitative values.",

The article examines theconstruction of the personal memories of those social actorswho did not have political power during the period of war,and the central focus is placed on the social and culturalcircumstances that influence the construction of personalwartime narratives. The article discusses and ultimatelyconcludes that the personal narratives are largely witness tothe previously planned, aggressive and genocidal nature ofSerbian politics led by Slobodan Milosevic which served asthe cause and start of the Croatian War of Independence.Furthermore, personal narratives reveal the large-scaledestruction of Croatian cities during the war (urbicide andculturocide), and the distancing of interpersonal (inter--national) relationships as a consequence of the war.Ultimately, although multilayered in their narrativeexplications, the personal narratives of people whoexperienced the Croatian War of Independence arecompatible with the concept of the Croatian War ofIndependence as an aggression towards Croatia, with theaim of destruction of the Croatian national identity andconquest of Croatian territory.",

abstract  = "This collection of essays assembles investigations of Brian O'Doherty's / Patrick Ireland's seminal work: his visual art practice, art criticism, institutional leadership and critique, media work, and literary writing. The international authors provide fresh perspectives on an oeuvre that has resonance on both sides of the Atlantic. O'Doherty's role in and for conceptual art and minimalism in New York through, among others, publication of a box-shaped journal, Aspen 5+6 (1967) is as much a theme as his seminal critique of the Modernist white cube gallery (Inside the White Cube, 1976), his art-historical ventures, and Irish origins. O'Doherty's key role in creating funding mechanisms for conceptual and live art in the US (as a Director of the National Endowment for the Arts) is featured, together with his differentiation and calling into question of many categories, such as landscape, drawing, the senses, and word and image relations. He anticipated many now current concerns, especially art writing and artistic research. This new appreciation of his work is achieved through the diversity of historical and theoretical responses that characterizes this anthology. The focus, however, lies on his mode of thinking, which embraces the paradox. It can be recognized in the single-minded pursuit of his art practice and his other monumental contributions to twentieth-century culture, i.e. between institution and institutional critique, both inside and outside the white cube, and in word and image. He sits in the most fruitful place: between all the stools - and he has thought through what it may mean when those working in and with art find themselves there.",

Explicit analytic expressions are derived for determining the fluxes for steady-state permeation of binary mixtures of species 1 and 2 across a membrane (m), clearly delineating the relative influences of the 1-m, 2-m and interspecies (1-2) frictional contributions. Simplified expressions are derived for two limiting scenarios: negligible 1-2 friction and dominant 1-2 friction; these scenarios help to determine the upper and lower bounds of permeation fluxes and selectivities. The developed model is used to analyze a wide variety of published experimental data on mixture permeation across zeolite and polymer membranes. In each case, the influence of 1-2 friction is analyzed. In cases such as pervaporation across polymer membranes, the 1-2 frictional contribution is found to be extremely significant.",

A total of 26 experts, consisting of 12 educators, 9 guides, and 5 teacher trainers, rated the importance of the competencies and the clearness of the formulation on a 5-point Likert scale. In two rounds, consensus was established on 45 competencies. We organized the competencies into four areas: (1) handling the group within the museum environment, (2) communication skills, (3) knowledge and pedagogy, and (4) professionalism. The list of competencies gives museums insight into the competencies museum guides should have, can help guides reflect on their own practices, and stimulates them to further develop their own competencies.",

abstract  = "Understanding the impact of landscape-scale disturbance events during the last glacial period is vital in accurately reconstructing the ecosystem dynamics of montane environments. Here, a sedimentary succession from the tropical montane cloud forest of the eastern Andean flank of Ecuador provides evidence of the role of non-climate drivers of vegetation change (volcanic events, fire regime and herbivory) during the late-Pleistocene. Multiproxy analysis (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal, geochemistry and carbon content) of the sediments, radiocarbon dated to ca. 45-42 ka, provide a snap shot of the depositional environment, vegetation community and non-climate drivers of ecosystem dynamics. The geomorphology of the Vinillos study area, along with the organic-carbon content, and aquatic remains suggest deposition took place near a valley floor in a swamp or shallow water environment. The pollen assemblage initially composed primarily of herbaceous types (Poaceae-Asteraceae-Solanaceae) is replaced by assemblages characterised by Andean forest taxa, (first Melastomataceae-Weinmannia-Ilex, and later, Alnus-Hedyosmum-Myrica). The pollen assemblages have no modern analogues in the tropical montane cloud forest of Ecuador. High micro-charcoal and rare macro-charcoal abundances co-occur with volcanic tephra deposits suggesting transportation from extra-local regions and that volcanic eruptions were an important source of ignition in the wider glacial landscape. The presence of the coprophilous fungi Sporormiella reveals the occurrence of herbivores in the glacial montane forest landscape. Pollen analysis indicates a stable regional vegetation community, with changes in vegetation population co-varying with large volcanic tephra deposits suggesting that the structure of glacial vegetation community at Vinillos was driven by volcanic activity.",

Here, we use ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy and dielectric-relaxation spectroscopy to observe the random orientational motion of water molecules inside living cells of three prototypical organisms: Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and spores of Bacillus subtilis. In all three organisms, most of the intracellular water exhibits the same random orientational motion as neat water (characteristic time constants similar to 9 and similar to 2 ps for the first-order and second-order orientational correlation functions), whereas a smaller fraction exhibits slower orientational dynamics. The fraction of slow intracellular water varies between organisms, ranging from similar to 20% in E. coli to similar to 45% in B. subtilis spores. Comparison with the water dynamics observed in solutions mimicking the chemical composition of (parts of) the cytosol shows that the slow water is bound mostly to proteins, and to a lesser extent to other biomolecules and ions.",

Young historians, eager to professionalise their craft and to incorporate new social theories and methods, dismissed biography as a short-sighted, subjective, bias, nationalistic and old-fashioned way of writing history. Today, academia still struggles to recognise biographical writing as a scientific genre, and therefore it remains controversial. Or as Richard Holmes has put it: 'For the most part, it has been left to itself, outside the established institutes of learning'. Biographers have attempted to counteract the academic loss of status by 'using' theoretical concepts from other disciplines like micro- and metahistory. But by doing so they more or less have failed to ask themselves whether biography as a discipline initially was rightfully sacrificed by academic historians in their pursuit of history as a modern, objective and professional science.",

In more recent publications the researchers suggested also anthropogenic causes.In the Gutland, mardels occur on various substrates. Mardels on the Strassen marls (li3) are abandoned quarries, related to clay excavation in Roman Time; (li2) the clay was deposited in depressions, related to joints in the underlying Luxembourger sandstone formation. Mardels on the Keuper marls (km1,3) are originally subsidence basins, related to subsurface dissolutions of gypsum lenses and veins, filled with colluvial clay. The results of pollen analysis and archaeometrical tests point to Roman extraction of mardel clay for the production of pottery. In conclusion, the natural depressions have been enlarged to the present mardels. After the depart of the Romans, the sedimentation of clayey colluvium restarted in the abandoned quarries.",

To minimize the disadvantages of existing approaches, like the surface effect of nanoparticles, autofluorescence, and/or the thermal effect described herein, a bifunctional (simultaneous in vivo bioimaging and local tissue temperature sensing) ratiometric afterglow nanothermometer has been realized in the physiological temperature range (298-325 K) based on persistent luminescent Cr3+ (with d electron configuration)-doped zinc gallogermanate nanoparticles. The contributions of the radiative E-2 --- (4)A(2) and T-4(2) --- (4)A(2) transitions of surface and interior Cr3+ to the near-infrared afterglow dual emissions are modeled, and the measured thermal sensitivities (0.043-0.047 K-1) for detecting the temperature of a human serum albumin solution are 1 order of magnitude higher than those using an upconverting luminescent nanoparticle strategy. For a local tissue with various thicknesses (0-15 mm), a similar detection sensitivity can be obtained because of the use of the near-infrared wavelength. Meanwhile, in situ temperature sensing can recur after near-infrared light (808 nm) re-excitation.",

abstract  = "Nitrene radical complexes are reactive intermediates with discrete spin density at the nitrogen-atom of the nitrene moiety. These species have become important intermediates for organic synthesis, being invoked in a broad range of C-H functionalization and aziridination reactions. Nitrene radical complexes have intriguing electronic structures, and are best described as one-electron reduced Fischer type nitrenes. They can be generated by intramolecular single electron transfer to the ``redox non-innocent'' nitrene moiety at the metal. Nitrene radicals generated at open-shell cobalt(II) have thus far received most attention in terms of spectroscopic characterization, reactivity screening, catalytic nitrene-transfer reactions and (computational and experimental) mechanistic studies, but some interesting iron and precious metal catalysts have also been employed in related reactions involving nitrene radicals. In some cases, redox-active ligands are used to facilitate intramolecular single electron transfer from the complex to the nitrene moiety. Organic azides are among the most attractive nitrene precursors in this field, typically requiring pre-activated organic azides (e.g. RSO2N3, (RO)(2)P(=O)N-3, ROC(=O)N-3 and alike) to achieve efficient and selective catalysis. Challenging, non-activated aliphatic organic azides were recently added to the palette of reagents useful in synthetically relevant reactions proceeding via nitrene radical intermediates. This concept article describes the electronic structure of nitrene radical complexes, emphasizes on their usefulness in the catalytic synthesis of various organic products, and highlights the important developments in the field.",

abstract  = "Tracking changes in biodiversity through time requires an understanding of the relationship between modern diversity and how this diversity is preserved in the fossil record. Fossil pollen is one way in which past vegetation diversity can be reconstructed. However, there is limited understanding of modern pollen-vegetation diversity relationships from biodiverse tropical ecosystems. Here, pollen (palynological) richness and diversity (Hill N1) are compared with vegetation richness and diversity from forest and savannah ecosystems in the New World and Old World tropics (Neotropics and Palaeotropics). Modern pollen data were obtained from artificial pollen traps deployed in 1-ha vegetation study plots from which vegetation inventories had been completed in Bolivia and Ghana. Pollen counts were obtained from 15 to 22 traps per plot, and aggregated pollen sums for each plot were -- 2,500. The palynological richness/diversity values from the Neotropics were moist evergreen forest = 86/6.8, semi-deciduous dry forest = 111/21.9, wooded savannah = 138/31.5, and from the Palaeotropics wet evergreen forest = 144/28.3, semi-deciduous moist forest = 104/4.4, forest-savannah transition = 121/14.1; the corresponding vegetation richness/diversity was 100/36.7, 80/38.7 and 71/39.4 (Neotropics), and 101/54.8, 87/45.5 and 71/34.5 (Palaeotropics). No consistent relationship was found between palynological richness/diversity, and plot vegetation richness/diversity, due to the differential influence of other factors such as landscape diversity, pollination strategy, and pollen source area. Palynological richness exceeded vegetation richness, while pollen diversity was lower than vegetation diversity. The relatively high global diversity of tropical vegetation was found to be reflected in the pollen rain.",

abstract  = "Rational design of catalysts for asymmetric transformations is a longstanding challenge in the field of catalysis. In the current contribution we report a catalyst in which a hydrogen bond between the substrate and the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and the rate of the catalytic hydrogenation reaction, as is evident from a combination of experiments and DFT calculations. Detailed insight allowed in silico mutation of the catalyst such that only this hydrogen bond interaction is stronger, predicting that the new catalyst is faster. Indeed, we experimentally confirmed that optimization of the catalyst can be realized by increasing the hydrogen bond strength of this interaction by going from a urea to phosphine oxide H-bond acceptor on the ligand.",

abstract  = "Although regime shifts are known from various ecosystems, the involvement of microbial communities is poorly understood. Here we show that gradual environmental changes induced by, for example, eutrophication or global warming can induce major oxic-anoxic regime shifts. We first investigate a mathematical model describing interactions between microbial communities and biogeochemical oxidation-reduction reactions. In response to gradual changes in oxygen influx, this model abruptly transitions between an oxic state dominated by cyanobacteria and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The model predictions are consistent with observations from a seasonally stratified lake, which shows hysteresis in the transition between oxic and anoxic states with similar changes in microbial community composition. Our results suggest that hysteresis loops and tipping points are a common feature of oxic-anoxic transitions, causing rapid drops in oxygen levels that are not easily reversed, at scales ranging from small ponds to global oceanic anoxic events.",

abstract  = "Samples taken from sedimentary archives indicate that fungal non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) can be used to provide information on forest cover, fire regime, and depositional environment in the eastern Andean flank montane forest of Ecuador. Within the 52 samples examined, 54 fungal NPP morphotypes are reported, of which 25 were found to be previously undescribed. Examination of fungal NPPs over a gradient of forest cover (2-64%) revealed three distinct assemblages: (1) low (--8%) forest cover Neurospora, IBB-16, HdV-201, OU-102, and OU-110 indicative of an open degraded landscape; (2) medium (8-32%) forest cover Cercophora-type 1, Xylariaceae, Rosellinia-type, Kretzschmaria deusta, Amphirosellinia, Sporormiella, and Glomus suggestive of a forested landscape disturbed by herbivores and soil erosion; and (3) high (32-63%) forest cover Anthostomella fuegiana, OU-5, OU-101, OU-108, and OU-120. Environmental variables for forest cover (forest pollen), available moisture (aquatic remains), regional fire regime (microcharcoal), and sediment composition (organic carbon) were found to explain ~40% of the variance in the fungal NPP data set. Fire was found to be the primary control on fungal NPP assemblage composition, with available moisture and sediment composition the next most important factors.",

In these experiments, children typically view a stimulus episode alone; however, we know that children often watch with others at home (Chandler, 1997). Thus, in this study we examined how children's proximal social context during viewing influenced effects. Using data collected from a 3-condition experiment (control, view-alone, coview with close friend) with Dutch children ages 5 and 6 (N = 80), we found that exposure largely did not influence children's inclusion judgments or stigmatization beliefs. There was, however, an age x condition interaction, such that 6-year-old children in the coview condition demonstrated greater stigmatization beliefs toward other children, compared to 5-year-olds in the same condition, or all children in the other conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings while considering previous work on learning inclusion from prosocial television shows, reality judgments, and the bystander effect.",

Physiotherapists need to be able to screen for the presence of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH), so they can adjust their treatment strategies to the type of headache. A quick screening questionnaire to recognize migraine and TTH in the physiotherapy practice is needed. Objective The aim of this study was to create a headache screening questionnaire based on the ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine and TTH, and to establish its content and criterion validity. Design A cross-sectional design was used during the validation phase of the study. Methods A screening questionnaire was developed for migraine and TTH. Content validity was checked by the research group and a headache research expert. For validation of this questionnaire, patients from the headache clinic of the Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital in Nijmegen were recruited. The outcome of the questionnaire was compared to the ICHD-3 beta diagnosis of the headache specialist. For criterion validity, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and positive- and negative predictive values were calculated. Results A 10-item questionnaire has been developed: the Headache Screening Questionnaire. For validation of the Dutch version (HSQ-DV), 105 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.89 and 0.54 respectively for probable migraine, and for probable TTH 0.92 and 0.48 respectively. Conclusion The HSQ-DV is a sensitive screening tool to detect patients with probable migraine and probable TTH.",

abstract  = "Background Alkali production via arginine deiminase system (ADS) of oral bacteria plays a significant role in oral ecology, pH homeostasis and inhibition of dental caries. ADS activity in dental plaque varies greatly between individuals, which may profoundly affect their susceptibility to caries. Objective To investigate the effect of arginine on the growth and biofilm formation of oral bacteria. Methods and results Polymicrobial dental biofilms derived from saliva were formed in a high-throughput active attachment biofilm model and L-arginine (Arg) was shown to reduce the colony forming units (CFU) counts of such biofilms grown for various periods or biofilms derived from saliva of subjects with different caries status. Arg hardly disturbed bacterial growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii in BHI medium, but only inhibited biofilm formation of S. mutans. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed S. mutans biofilms harboured fewer cells grown with Arg than that without Arg, even in the initial 2 h and 8 h phase. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images of poly-microbial dental and S. mutans biofilms revealed the biofilms grown with Arg had lower exopolysaccharide (EPS)/bacteria ratios than those without Arg (P = 0.004, 0.002, respectively). Arg could significantly reduce the production of water-insoluble EPS in S. mutans biofilms (P -- 0.001); however, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) did not show significantly influence in gene expression of gtfB, gtfC or gtfD (P = 0.32, 0.06, 0.44 respectively). Conclusions Arg could reduce the biomass of poly-microbial dental biofilms and S. mutans biofilms, which may be due to the impact of Arg on water-insoluble EPS. Considering the contribution to pH homeostasis in dental biofilms, Arg may serve as an important agent keeping oral biofilms healthy thus prevent dental caries.",

abstract  = "Objectives The aberrant expression of mucins and mucin-type carbohydrates has been described in many types of cancer, including mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), a malignant salivary gland tumor. In this study, we examined the aberrant expression patterns of mucins (MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC and MUC5B), simple mucin-type carbohydrate antigens (Tn, sialyl-Tn and T) and mature carbohydrate antigens (Lewisa and sulfo-Lewisa antigens) in MEC originating from the parotid gland, which normally does not secrete mucins. Design We conducted an immunohistochemical study to investigate the presence of mucins and carbohydrates in 24 MEC samples originating from the parotid gland and in surrounding normal tissue of the same gland in comparison 6 samples of normal salivary glands. The expression levels were compared with respect to the histological grading. Furthermore, 24 MEC samples from non-parotid salivary glands were included. Results We observed loss of topology of membrane-bound MUC1 and MUC4, and de novo expression of MUC5AC, MUC5B and sialyl-Tn in MEC that originated in the parotid gland. Furthermore, mucins MUC1, MUC4 and carbohydrate antigens Tn, sialyl-Tn, T, Lewisa and sulfo-Lewisa were overexpressed in MEC samples compared to surrounding normal salivary gland tissues. MUC1 was expressed in both low- and high grade MECs, whereas MUC4 was not expressed in high grade MECs of the parotid gland. Conclusion During the development of MEC in the parotid gland, the genes for gel-forming secretory mucins are switched on. Besides these MEC tissues overexpress short oligosaccharides, suggesting that the glycosylation machinery is altered.",

abstract  = "Query-based searching and browsing-based navigation are the two main components of exploratory search. Search lets users dig in deep by controlling their actions to focus on and find just the information they need, whereas navigation helps them to get an overview to decide which content is most important. In this paper, we introduce the concept of 'search powered navigation' and investigate the effect of empowering navigation with search functionality on information seeking behavior of users and their experience by conducting a user study on exploratory search tasks, differentiated by different types of information needs. Our main findings are as follows: First, we observe radically different search tactics. Using search, users are able to control and augment their search focus, hence they explore the data in a depth-first, bottom-up manner. Conversely, using pure navigation they tend to check different options to be able to decide on their path into the data, which corresponds to a breadth-first, top-down exploration. Second, we observe a general natural tendency to combine aspects of search and navigation, however, our experiments show that the search functionality is essential to solve exploratory search tasks that require finding documents related to a narrow domain. Third, we observe a natural need for search powered navigation: users using a system without search functionality find creative ways to mimic searching using navigation.",

abstract  = "Peri-implant infection control is crucial for implant fixation and durability. Antimicrobial administration approaches to control peri-implant infection are far from satisfactory. During bacterial infection, pH level around the peri-implant surface decreases as low as pH 5.5. This change of pH can be used as a switch to control antimicrobial drug release from the implant surface. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. In this study, we aimed to design a pH-dependent AgNPs releasing titania nanotube arrays (TNT) implant for peri-implant infection control. The nanotube arrays were fabricated on the surface of titanium implant as containers; AgNPs were grafted on TNT implant surface via a low pH-sensitive acetal linker (TNT-AL-AgNPs). SEM, TEM, AFM, FTIR as well as XPS data showed that AgNPs have been successfully linked to TNT via acetal linker without affecting the physicochemical characteristics of TNT. The pH 5.5 enhanced AgNPs release from TNT-AL-AgNPs implant compared with pH 7.4. AgNPs released at pH 5.5 robustly increased antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria compared with AgNPs released at pH 7.4. TNT-AL-AgNPs implant enhanced osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and did not affect osteoblast morphology in vitro. In conclusion, incorporation of AgNPs in TNT via acetal linker maintained the surface characteristics of TNT. TNT-AL-AgNPs implant was biocompatible to osteoblasts and showed osteoinductive properties. AgNPs were released from TNT-AL-AgNPs implant in high dose at pH 5.5, and this release showed strong antimicrobial properties in vitro. Therefore, this novel design of low pH-triggered AgNPs releasing TNT-AL-AgNPs could be an infection-triggered antimicrobial releasing implant model to control peri-implant infection.",

abstract  = "Surface acoustic wave nebulisation (SAWN) mass spectrometry (MS) is a method to generate gaseous ions compatible with direct MS of minute samples at femtomole sensitivity. To perform SAWN, acoustic waves are propagated through a LiNbO3 sampling chip, and are conducted to the liquid sample, which ultimately leads to the generation of a fine mist containing droplets of nanometre to micrometre diameter. Through fission and evaporation, the droplets undergo a phase change from liquid to gaseous analyte ions in a non-destructive manner. We have developed SAWN technology for the characterisation of organic colourants in textiles. It generates electrospray-ionisation-like ions in a non-destructive manner during ionisation, as can be observed by the unmodified chemical structure. The sample size is decreased by tenfold to 1000-fold when compared with currently used liquid chromatography-MS methods, with equal or better sensitivity. This work underscores SAWN-MS as an ideal tool for molecular analysis of art objects as it is non-destructive, is rapid, involves minimally invasive sampling and is more sensitive than current MS-based methods.

title     = "What exactly distinguishes aggressive from chronic periodontitis: is it mainly a difference in the degree of bacterial invasiveness?",
abstract  = "At the International Workshop for Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions in 1999, the classification of aggressive and chronic periodontitis that is presently used was introduced. A literature review of papers published in 2015 and having aggressive periodontitis in the title revealed that most studies use this terminology but it is questionable whether all established criteria were really applied correctly. Review of the literature showed no qualitative differences between aggressive and chronic periodontitis regarding bacterial and viral aspects. It is also unlikely that that there are major immunologic differences between aggressive and chronic periodontitis. Neutrophil function can be compromised in both conditions but may be more genetically related in aggressive periodontitis and be associated more with lifestyle factors in chronic periodontitis. In general, genetics plays a more important role in aggressive periodontitis than in chronic periodontitis. It is likely that periodontitis progresses by recurrent acute episodes during which invasion of bacteria into the connective tissue may occur. Two cases are presented for which invasive periodontitis is treated with systemic antibiotics, showing remarkable periodontal healing in terms of probing attachment gain, as well as radiographic bone gain. Periodontitis in an active state with bacterial invasion is probably accompanied with a significant increase in subgingival temperature. It is hypothesized that elevated subgingival temperature may help to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial invasive periodontitis. Scaling and root planing during a burst of disease activity may result in removal of connective tissue fiber attachment and down-growth of epithelium, thereby preventing the reattachment of connective tissue. Because the burst of disease is accompanied by an increase of temperature, assessment of the temperature may help in deciding whether or not to prescribe systemic antibiotics. When the use of systemic antibiotics is indicated, the antibiotic therapy may help to maintain the connective tissue attachment at the most possible coronal level. The above implies that the ability to diagnose bacterial invasive periodontitis is quite important, and future research is needed to determine if assessment of subgingival temperature may help in diagnosing invasive periodontitis. In addition, it is suggested that future classification systems of periodontitis include the item of bacterial invasive periodontitis.",

abstract  = "The present paper proposes a new introductory treatment of the very well known Sahlqvist correspondence theory for classical modal logic. The first motivation for the present treatment is a consideration regarding exposition: classical Sahlqvist correspondence is presented in a uniform and modular way, and, unlike the existing textbook accounts, extends itself to a class of formulas laying outside the Sahlqvist class proper. The second motivation is methodological: the present treatment aims at highlighting the algebraic and order-theoretic nature of the correspondence mechanism. The exposition remains elementary and does not presuppose any previous knowledge or familiarity with the algebraic approach to logic. However, it provides the underlying motivation and basic intuitions for the recent developments in the Sahlqvist theory of nonclassical logics, which compose the so-called unified correspondence theory.",

Various trends such as population ageing put these schemes under serious pressure, however. Whether this is good or bad depends among other things on two factors: one is the value of the risk sharing between generations that is organized by pension schemes, and another is the cost of the distortions of labour supply decisions that these collective schemes imply. This paper constructs a model with overlapping generations of households and a pension scheme to assess the role of these two factors. The paper finds that the welfare gain from intergenerational risk sharing generally dominates the cost of labour supply distortions.",

Though it remains elusive which therapeutic elements are responsible for the beneficial effects on nightmare symptoms, imagery rescripting (IR) and imaginal exposure (IE) are commonly identified as active treatment components of nightmare therapies. With this randomized controlled trial, we compared IR and IE as individual treatments to a wait-list (WL) condition to determine whether these particular therapeutic elements ameliorate nightmare symptoms. For this purpose, 104 patients with a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of nightmare disorder were randomly assigned to three weekly individual sessions of either IR or IE, or WL. Results showed that compared to WL, both interventions effectively reduced nightmare frequency (DdIR-WL = 0.74; DdIE-WL = 0.70) and distress (DdIR-WL = 0.98; DdIE-WL = 1.35) in a sample that predominantly consisted of idiopathic nightmare sufferers. The effects of IR and IE were comparable to those observed for other psychological nightmare treatments. Initial effects at post-treatment were sustained at 3- and 6-months follow-up, indicating that IR and IE both seem to be efficacious treatment components of nightmare therapies. Additional research is needed to directly compare IR and IE among both idiographic and posttraumatic nightmare sufferers with respect to treatment expectancy, acceptability, and effectiveness.",

abstract  = "This study aims to investigate the role of daily vitality as an energy-based mechanism through which sleep quantity and quality relate to proactive behavior. In addition, we propose that daily self-efficacy forms a contingency condition in that self-efficacy facilitates the translation of vitality into proactive behavior. We conducted a 7-day diary study based on a sample of 66 employees who completed surveys 3 times daily. We used multilevel regression analyses to test the hypotheses while controlling for the 1-day lagged measures of vitality and proactivity. The results provide evidence for a model of moderated mediation. Sleep quality but not quantity predicted an increase in daily vitality. Self-efficacy moderated the relationship between vitality and daily proactivity such that this relationship was stronger when self-efficacy was reported to be high rather than low. The conditional effect mediated by vitality was significant for sleep quality but not for sleep quantity and occurred at the within-person level of analysis. These results suggest that organizations aiming to boost daily proactivity in employees can benefit from increasing employees' self-efficacy and supporting them in developing strategies to ensure sufficient vitality. One such strategy is improving sleep quality. This study extends the literature on dynamics in proactive work behavior and its well-being-related antecedents by exploring both vitality as an underlying energetic mechanism and daily self-efficacy as a boundary condition.",

Findings exposing the vast plasticity and potential of NSPCs have accumulated over the past years and we currently know that adult NSPCs can naturally give rise not only to neurons but also to astrocytes and reactive astrocytes, and eventually to oligodendrocytes through genetic manipulation. We can consider NSPCs as endogenous flexible tools to fight against neurodegenerative and neurological disorders and aging. In addition, NSPCs can be considered as active agents contributing to chronic brain alterations and as relevant cell populations to be preserved, so that their main function, neurogenesis, is not lost in damage or disease. Altogether we believe that learning to manipulate NSPC is essential to prevent, ameliorate or restore some of the cognitive deficits associated with brain disease and injury, and therefore should be considered as target for future therapeutic strategies. The first step to accomplish this goal is to target them specifically, by unveiling and understanding their unique markers and signaling pathways.",

Such reuse of existing data for further research requires Findable; Accessible; Interoperable; Reusable (FAIR) data management and stewardship. We here describe the inventory and development of a comprehensive European dataset compendium and the process towards cross-European secondary data analyses of pooled data on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and their correlates across the life course.Methods A five-step methodology was followed by the European Determinants of Diet and Physical Activity (DEDIPAC) Knowledge Hub, covering the (1) identification of relevant datasets across Europe, (2) development of a compendium including details on the design, study population, measures and level of accessibility of data from each study, (3) definition of key topics and approaches for secondary analyses, (4) process of gaining access to datasets and (5) pooling and harmonisation of the data and the development of a data harmonisation platform.Results A total of 114 unique datasets were found for inclusion within the DEDIPAC compendium. Of these datasets, 14 were eventually obtained and reused to address 10 exemplar research questions. The DEDIPAC data harmonisation platform proved to be useful for pooling, but in general, harmonisation was often restricted to just a few core (crude) outcome variables and some individual-level sociodemographic correlates of these behaviours.Conclusions Obtaining, pooling and harmonising data for secondary data analyses proved to be difficult and sometimes even impossible. Compliance to FAIR data management and stewardship principles currently appears to be limited for research in the field of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. We discuss some of the reasons why this might be the case and present recommendations based on our experience.",

Typically, training such a system requires activity labels to be both completely and accurately annotated. In this paper, we go beyond such restriction and propose a learning method that allow labels to be incomplete and uncertain. We introduce the idea of soft labels which allows annotators to assign multiple, and weighted labels to data segments. This is very useful in many situations, e.g., when the labels are uncertain, when part of the labels are missing, or when multiple annotators assign inconsistent labels. We formulate the activity recognition task as a sequential labeling problem. Latent variables are embedded in the model in order to exploit sub-level semantics for better estimation. We propose a max-margin framework which incorporate soft labels for learning the model parameters. The model is evaluated on two challenging datasets. To simulate the uncertainty in data annotation, we randomly change the labels for transition segments. The results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach.",

abstract  = "Glutamate and GABA play an important role in substance dependence. However, it remains unclear whether this holds true for different substance use disorders and how this is related to risk-related traits such as impulsivity. We, therefore, compared Glx (as a proxy measure for glutamate) and GABA concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of 48 male cigarette smokers, 61 male smoking polysubstance users, and 90 male healthy controls, and investigated the relationship with self-reported impulsivity and substance use. Glx and GABA concentrations were measured using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Impulsivity, smoking, alcohol and cocaine use severity and cannabis use were measured using self-report instruments. Results indicate a trend towards group differences in Glx. Post-hoc analyses showed a difference between smokers and healthy controls (p=0.04) and a trend towards higher concentrations in smoking polysubstance users and healthy controls (p=0.09), but no differences between smokers and smoking polysubstance users. dACC GABA concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Smoking polysubstance users were more impulsive than smokers, and both groups were more impulsive than controls. No significant associations were observed between dACC neurotransmitter concentrations and impulsivity and level and severity of smoking, alcohol or cocaine use or the presence of cannabis use. The results indicate that differences in dACC Glx are unrelated to type and level of substance use. No final conclusion can be drawn on the lack of GABA differences due to assessment difficulties. The relationship between dACC neurotransmitter concentrations and cognitive impairments other than self-reported impulsivity should be further investigated.",

title     = "Qualitative screening for new psychoactive substances in wastewater collected during a city festival using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry",
abstract  = "The inclusion of new psychoactive substances (NPS) in the wastewater-based epidemiology approach presents challenges, such as the reduced number of users that translates into low concentrations of residues and the limited pharmacokinetics information available, which renders the choice of target biomarker difficult. The sampling during special social settings, the analysis with improved analytical techniques, and data processing with specific workflow to narrow the search, are required approaches for a successful monitoring. This work presents the application of a qualitative screening technique to wastewater samples collected during a city festival, where likely users of recreational substances gather and consequently higher residual concentrations of used NPS are expected. The analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Data were processed using an algorithm that involves the extraction of accurate masses (calculated based on molecular formula) of expected m/z from an in-house database containing about 2,000 entries, including NPS and transformation products. We positively identified eight NPS belonging to the classes of synthetic cathinones, phenethylamines and opioids. In addition, the presence of benzodiazepine analogues, classical drugs and other licit substances with potential for abuse was confirmed. The screening workflow based on a database search was useful in the identification of NPS biomarkers in wastewater. The findings highlight the specific classical drugs and low NPS use in the Netherlands. Additionally, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B), and 4-fluoroamphetamine (FA) were identified in wastewater for the first time.",

Self-effects are the effects of messages the cognitions, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors of the message creators/senders themselves. A total of 4 theories have tried to explain self-effects in offline environments: self-persuasion, self-concept change, expressive writing, and political deliberation. The article reviews research into online self-effects that evolved from each of these theories, and argues why self-effects may be stronger online than offline. Based on this review, a model is introduced that helps explain how online self- and reception effects may coalesce and amplify each other. The article ends by presenting some suggestions for future research.",

abstract  = "This study was designed to explore the nature and features of cannabis festivals, characteristics of festival participants, and reasons for attendance. A field study in two European cities (Amsterdam and Berlin) included participant observation at the festivals, interviews with local organizers, and a survey among festival attendees (n = 728). Both festivals had common features, but also showed distinct differences. At both festivals, nine out of 10 participants were current, often daily cannabis users. Participants were mainly young adults (mean = 26.2 years), but younger in Berlin than in Amsterdam. Common reasons for festival attendance were 'protest/activism' and 'entertainment.' Protest/activism was more likely in Berlin, among daily cannabis users, and participants aged 25+ years. Entertainment was more likely in Amsterdam, among non-daily cannabis users, and participants younger than 25 years. Although similar in political aim, cannabis festivals are characterized by distinctive local features, as well as differences in attendee profile and reasons for festival participation. Findings suggest that the latter differences are driven by differences in cannabis policy, with a stronger tendency towards protest/activism in countries with a less liberal, or more restrictive, cannabis policy. Future research should include more countries, representing a wider variation in cannabis policies.",

abstract  = "Spinel-phase Zn2Ga2.98-xGe0.75O8:Cr-0.020, Pr-x (ZGGO:Cr3+, Pr3+) near infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) with different amounts of Pr3+ dopant were prepared by a hydrothermal method in combination with a subsequent annealing in a vacuum. For these nanoparticles, the averaged particle size decreases from 64 to 37 nm with increasing Pr3+ doping concentration from 0 to 0.025 and Cr3+ and Pr3+ ions are uniformly doped into the interior and surface of a single nanoparticle. It can be found that Pr3+ doping leads to the appearance of more anti-site pairs (Ga-Zn degrees - Zn-Ga') around distorted octahedral Cr3+ ions and enhanced NIR emissions around 697 nm, which originate from the E-2((2)G) --- (4)A(2)(F-4) and T-4(2)(F-4) --- (4)A(2)(F-4) transitions of the interior and surface Cr3+ ions in the nanoparticles. In particular, for the interior Cr3+ ions in the Pr3+ doped nanoparticles, the enhanced NIR luminescence can be attributed to the suppressed energy transfer of the excited electrons from the T-4(2)(F-4) level to the trap level related to anti-site pairs (Ga-Zn degrees - Zn-Ga') around the distorted octahedral Cr3+ ions. Our results suggest that Pr3+ doped ZGGO:Cr3+ PLNPs have potential applications for bio-imaging.",

We find that characteristics of contested statehood mediate EU engagement and impact: the lack of international recognition limits EU's engagement but encourages development promotion, international integration and assistance of local civil society. Lack of territorial control limits engagement, but ineffective government offers opportunities for development promotion and state-building. As such, and in addition to offering a rich empirical account of two prominent contested states, the article contributes to the discussion of international engagement by developing an innovative conceptual framework for understanding EU's impact on contested states--a topic neglected within a literature dominated by conventional statehood or conflict resolution themes but very important given extensive international engagement in contested states--and related conflicts.",

We evaluated the context, dose delivered and received, and patients' and physiotherapists' satisfaction with the intervention.Ninety-two per cent of the patients trained within 15 km of their home address, with an average session attendance of 86%. Most patients trained at the prescribed intensity for four of the six resistance exercises, but the dose delivered and received of the two remaining resistance exercises and interval training could not be determined. Both patients and physiotherapists highly appreciated the programme (score of 8.3 and 7.9 out of 10 respectively). This process evaluation provided valuable lessons for future trials: (1) It is possible to deliver supervised exercise training to this patient group in local physiotherapy practices; (2) to determine dose received all intervention components should be standardised; and (3) to optimise data collection, all study materials should be tested more extensively prior to the start of the intervention.",

Since the size of axial ligand in JLU-Liu47 is smaller than that in JLU-Liu46, JLULiu47 shows larger pore volume and higher BET surface area. Then, the adsorption ability of JLU-Liu47 for some small gases is better than JLU-Liu46. It is worthwhile to mention that both of the two compounds exhibit outstanding adsorption capability for CO2 ascribed to the introducing of urea groups. In addition, the theoretical ideal adsorbed solution theory (LAST) calculation and transient breakthrough simulation indicate that JLU-Liu46 and JLU-Liu47 should be potential materials for gas storage and separation, particularly for CO2/N-2, CO2/CH4, and C3H8/CH4 separation.",

abstract  = "Bacteria frequently need to adapt to altered environmental conditions. Adaptation requires changes in gene expression, often mediated by global regulators of transcription. The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS is a key global regulator in Gram-negative bacteria and is believed to be a crucial player in bacterial chromatin organization via its DNA-bridging activity. H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors (osmolarity, pH, temperature) and interaction partners. Mechanistically, it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved. Here, we show that a diverse spectrum of H-NS modulators alter the DNA-bridging activity of H-NS. Changes in monovalent and divalent ion concentrations drive an abrupt switch between a bridging and non-bridging DNA-binding mode. Similarly, synergistic and antagonistic co-regulators modulate the DNA-bridging efficiency. Structural studies suggest a conserved mechanism: H-NS switches between a `closed' and an `open', bridging competent, conformation driven by environmental cues and interaction partners.",

Inward plasma membrane native proton pumps are yet unknown. We describe comprehensive functional studies of the representatives of the yet noncharacterized xenorhodopsins from Nanohaloarchaea family of microbial rhodopsins. They are inward proton pumps as we demonstrate in model membrane systems, Escherichia coli cells, human embryonic kidney cells, neuroblastoma cells, and rat hippocampal neuronal cells. We also solved the structure of a xenorhodopsin from the nanohalosarchaeon Nanosalina (NsXeR) and suggest a mechanism of inward proton pumping. We demonstrate that the NsXeR is a powerful pump, which is able to elicit action potentials in rat hippocampal neuronal cells up to their maximal intrinsic firing frequency. Hence, inwardly directed proton pumps are suitable for light-induced remote control of neurons, and they are an alternative to the well-known cation-selective channelrhodopsins.",

abstract  = "Demonstration turnout is a crucial political resource for social movements. In this article, we investigate how mass media cover demonstration size. We develop a typology of turnout coverage and scrutinize the factors that drive turnout coverage. In addition, we test whether media coverage underestimates, reflects, or exaggerates 'guesstimates' by organizers and police forces. Together, these analyses shed light on whether turnout coverage fits a logic of normalization or marginalization. We rely on a unique dataset of 428 demonstrations organized in Brussels (2003-2010). For these demonstrations, we have information on the turnout as reported in national television news, as counted by the police, and as expected by the organizers. We find that media present turnout most often as a fact, rarely as contentious (10 percent). Although few demonstrations pass the media gates, our study yields little to no evidence for a logic of turnout marginalization. Media coverage does not systematically underestimate demonstration size, nor does it blindly follow police counts. Rather, turnout coverage attests of a logic of normalization, following standard news-making practices. The more important the demonstration (size, lead item) and the larger the gap between police and organizer guesstimates, the more attention is paid to turnout in the news. Discussion centers on the generalizability and normative interpretation of the results.",

They evaluated Clinton as average on extraversion, agreeableness, openness, narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, but high on conscientiousness and emotional stability. Trump was rated very low on agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability, average on openness, and very high on extraversion and the Dark Triad. Results are consistent with previous research based on ratings from psychology scholars. Experts also evaluated their campaign style. Trump campaign was seen as populist, negative, and based on fear appeals.

title     = "Social disparities in food preparation behaviours: a DEDIPAC study",
abstract  = "Background The specific role of major socio-economic indicators in influencing food preparation behaviours could reveal distinct socio-economic patterns, thus enabling mechanisms to be understood that contribute to social inequalities in health. This study investigated whether there was an independent association of each socio-economic indicator (education, occupation, income) with food preparation behaviours. Methods A total of 62,373 adults participating in the web-based NutriNet-Sante cohort study were included in our cross-sectional analyses. Cooking skills, preparation from scratch and kitchen equipment were assessed using a 0-10-point score; frequency of meal preparation, enjoyment of cooking and willingness to cook better/more frequently were categorical variables. Independent associations between socio-economic factors (education, income and occupation) and food preparation behaviours were assessed using analysis of covariance and logistic regression models stratified by sex. The models simultaneously included the three socio-economic indicators, adjusting for age, household composition and whether or not they were the main cook in the household. Results Participants with the lowest education, the lowest income group and female manual and office workers spent more time preparing food daily than participants with the highest education, those with the highest income and managerial staff (P -- 0.0001). The lowest educated individuals were more likely to be non-cooks than those with the highest education level (Women: OR = 3.36 (1.69;6.69); Men: OR = 1.83 (1.07;3.16)) while female manual and office workers and the never-employed were less likely to be non-cooks (OR = 0.52 (0.28;0.97); OR = 0.30 (0.11;0.77)). Female manual and office workers had lower scores of preparation from scratch and were less likely to want to cook more frequently than managerial staff (P -- 0.001 and P -- 0.001). Women belonging to the lowest income group had a lower score of kitchen equipment (P -- 0.0001) and were less likely to enjoy cooking meal daily (OR = 0.68 (0.45;0.86)) than those with the highest income. Conclusion Lowest socio-economic groups, particularly women, spend more time preparing food than high socioeconomic groups. However, female manual and office workers used less raw or fresh ingredients to prepare meals than managerial staff. In the unfavourable context in France with reduced time spent preparing meals over last decades, our findings showed socioeconomic disparities in food preparation behaviours in women, whereas few differences were observed in men.",

abstract  = "Although rare, mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is one of the most common malignant salivary gland tumors. The presence of the t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation in a subset of MECs has raised interest in genomic aberrations in MEC. In the present study we conducted genome-wide copy-number-aberration analysis by micro-array comparative-genomic-hybridization on 27 MEC samples. Low/intermediate-grade MECs had significantly fewer copy-number-aberrations compared to high-grade MECs (low vs high: 3.48 vs 30; p = 0.0025; intermediate vs high: 5.7 vs 34.5; p = 0.036). The translocation-negative MECs contained more copy-number-aberrations than translocation-positive MECs (average amount of aberrations 15.9 vs 2.41; p =0.04). Within all 27 MEC samples, 16p11.2 and several regions on 8q were the most frequently gained regions , while 1q23.3 was the most frequently detected loss. Low/intermediate-grade MEC samples had copy-number-aberrations in chromosomes 1, 12 and 16, while high-grade MECs had a copy-number-aberration in 8p. The most commonly observed copy-number-aberration was the deletion of 3p14.1, which was observed in 4 of the translocation-negative MEC samples. No recurrent copy-number-aberrations were found in translocation-positive MEC samples. Based on these results, we conclude that MECs may be classified as follows: (i) t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation-positive tumors with no or few chromosomal aberrations and (ii) translocation-negative tumors with multiple chromosomal aberrations.",

Inspired by the reactive pocket of enzymes, a synthetic platform to combine photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with sulfide oxidation in a one-pot process via control over the location of the electron-transfer steps is developed. The redox-active coordination vessel Ni-TFT, which has an octahedral pocket, encapsulates an organic dye to pre-organize for photocatalytic proton reduction via an oxidative quenching pathway using the nickel corners as catalysts, generating molecular hydrogen and the oxidized dye. The oxidized dye is displaced by a neutral dye and oxidizes sulfide once outside the pocket to give element sulfur. The overall reaction constitutes hydrogen sulfide splitting, forming molecular hydrogen and elemental sulfur, which is analogous to the water-splitting reaction.",

abstract  = "Human biomonitoring, i.e. the determination of chemicals and/or their metabolites in human specimens, is the most common and potent tool for assessing human exposure to pesticides, but it suffers from limitations such as high costs and biases in sampling. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an innovative approach based on the chemical analysis of specific human metabolic excretion products (biomarkers) in wastewater, and provides objective and real-time information on xenobiotics directly or indirectly ingested by a population. This study applied the WBE approach for the first time to evaluate human exposure to pesticides in eight cities across Europe. 24 h-composite wastewater samples were collected from the main wastewater treatment plants and analyzed for urinary metabolites of three classes of pesticides, namely triazines, organophosphates and pyrethroids, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mass loads (mg/day/1000 inhabitants) were highest for organophosphates and lowest for triazines. Different patterns were observed among the cities and for the various classes of pesticides. Population weighted loads of specific biomarkers indicated higher exposure in Castellon, Milan, Copenhagen and Bristol for pyrethroids, and in Castellon, Bristol and Zurich for organophosphates. The lowest mass loads (mg/day/1000 inhabitants) were found in Utrecht and Oslo. These results were in agreement with several national statistics related to pesticides exposure such as pesticides sales. The daily intake of pyrethroids was estimated in each city and it was found to exceed the acceptable daily intake (ADI) only in one city (Castellon, Spain). This was the first large-scale application of WBE to monitor population exposure to pesticides. The results indicated that WBE can give new information about the 'average exposure' of the population to pesticides, and is a useful complementary biomonitoring tool to study population-wide exposure to pesticides.",

abstract  = "L-Ergothioneine (ET) is a sulfur-containing derivative of the amino acid histidine that offers unique antioxidant properties. The enzyme independent redox-chemistry of ET relies on the availability of the thiol tautomer to allow oxidative formation of disulfide bridges, i.e., the tautomeric equilibrium. To study the intrinsic properties of ET the tautomeric equilibrium is studied in the gas-phase by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. The IR ion spectra of isolated molecular ions of ET and of the biosynthetic precursors of ET, i.e., hercynine and N-epsilon-methyl-hercynine are acquired. The analyte structures are independently investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and computed linear IR-spectra of tautomer ion structures are compared with the gas-phase spectra for identification. For the molecular ion of ET the simulated IR spectra of thione and thiol structures match the recorded IRMPD spectrum and that prevents an individual structure assignment. On the other hand, theory suggests that ET adopts a thione tautomer in MeOH solution which could be carried over from the condensed phase to gas phase and could be kinetically trapped after effective electrospray phase transfer and desolvation. Such a non-thermal behavior is also found for the molecular ions of protonated hercynine and N-epsilon-methylhercynine. Contrary to that, the sodium complex ions of ET, hercynine and N-epsilon-methyl-hercynine adopt the respective ground structures predicted by theory, which are reliably identified spectroscopically. For ET the thione tautomer is by far the most stable isomer in the sodium complex molecular ion.",

Here, we demonstrate a new route to achieve nano-PCPs with an integrated pore system and physical properties using a reticular chemistry strategy. By optimizing the position and length of the shortest two alkyl groups in the channels, unprecedented phenomena of improved surface area, gas uptake, gas selectivity, thermal stability and chemical stability were observed in the PCPs, especially in NTU-14, the structure with a pendant ethyl group. Furthermore, the high performance of adsorption-and membrane-based separation makes NTU-14 a promising medium for CH4 purification from a mixture at room temperature.",

However, a structural control similar to that in supramolecular chemistry remains very challenging. Here, colloidal superstructures are built and controlled using critical Casimir forces on patchy colloidal particles. These solvent-mediated forces offer direct analogues of molecular bonds, allowing patch-to-patch binding with exquisite temperature control of bond strength and stiffness. Particles with two patches are shown to form linear chains undergoing morphological changes with temperature, resembling a polymer collapse under poor-solvent conditions. This reversible temperature switching carries over to particles with higher valency, exhibiting a variety of patch-to-patch bonded structures. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the collapse results from the growing interaction range favoring close-packed configurations. These results offer new opportunities for the active control of complex structures at the nano and micrometer scale, paving the way to novel temperature-switchable materials.",

abstract = "Mycobacterial infections cause a significant burden of disease and death worldwide. Their treatment is long, toxic, costly, and increasingly prone to failure due to bacterial resistance to currently available antibiotics. New therapeutic options are thus clearly needed. Antimicrobial peptides represent an important source of new antimicrobial molecules, both for their direct activity and for their immunomodulatory potential. We have previously reported that a short version of the bovine antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin with amino acids 17 to 30 (LFcin17-30), along with its variants obtained by specific amino acid substitutions, killed Mycobacterium avium in broth culture. In the present work, those peptides were tested against M. avium living inside its natural host cell, the macrophage. We found that the peptides increased the antimicrobial action of the conventional antibiotic ethambutol inside macrophages. Moreover, the d-enantiomer of the lactoferricin peptide (d-LFcin17-30) was more stable and induced significant killing of intracellular mycobacteria by itself. Interestingly, d-LFcin17-30 did not localize to M. avium-harboring phagosomes but induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the formation of lysosomes and autophagosome-like vesicles. These results lead us to conclude that d-LFcin17-30 primes macrophages for intracellular microbial digestion through phagosomal maturation and/or autophagy, culminating in mycobacterial killing. IMPORTANCE The genus Mycobacterium comprises several pathogenic species, including M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. avium, etc. Infections caused by these bacteria are particularly difficult to treat due to their intrinsic impermeability, low growth rate, and intracellular localization. Antimicrobial peptides are increasingly acknowledged as potential treatment tools, as they have a high spectrum of activity, low tendency to induce bacterial resistance, and immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we show that peptides derived from bovine lactoferricin (LFcin) improve the antimicrobial activity of ethambutol against Mycobacterium avium growing inside macrophages. Moreover, the d-enantiomer of a short version of lactoferricin containing amino acids 17 to 30 (d-LFcin17-30) causes intramacrophagic death of M. avium by increasing the formation of lysosomes and autophagosomes. This work opens the way to the use of lactoferricin-derived peptides to treat infections caused by mycobacteria and highlights important modulatory effects of d-FLcin17-30 on macrophages, which may be useful under other conditions in which macrophage activation is needed.",

title     = "Audiovisual Modulation in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex Depends on Cross-Modal Stimulus Configuration and Congruency",
abstract  = "The sensory neocortex is a highly connected associative network that integrates information from multiple senses, even at the level of the primary sensory areas. Although a growing body of empirical evidence supports this view, the neural mechanisms of cross-modal integration in primary sensory areas, such as the primary visual cortex (V1), are still largely unknown. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice, we show that the encoding of audiovisual stimuli in V1 neuronal populations is highly dependent on the features of the stimulus constituents. When the visual and auditory stimulus features were modulated at the same rate (i.e., temporally congruent), neurons responded with either an enhancement or suppression compared with unisensory visual stimuli, and their prevalence was balanced. Temporally incongruent tones or white-noise bursts included in audiovisual stimulus pairs resulted in predominant response suppression across the neuronal population. Visual contrast did not influence multisensory processing when the audiovisual stimulus pairs were congruent; however, when white-noise bursts were used, neurons generally showed response suppression when the visual stimulus contrast was high whereas this effect was absent when the visual contrast was low. Furthermore, a small fraction of V1 neurons, predominantly those located near the lateral border of V1, responded to sound alone. These results show that V1 is involved in the encoding of cross-modal interactions in a more versatile way than previously thought.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The neural substrate of cross-modal integration is not limited to specialized cortical association areas but extends to primary sensory areas. Using two-photon imaging of large groups of neurons, we show that multisensory modulation of V1 populations is strongly determined by the individual and shared features of cross-modal stimulus constituents, such as contrast, frequency, congruency, and temporal structure. Congruent audiovisual stimulation resulted in a balanced pattern of response enhancement and suppression compared with unisensory visual stimuli, whereas incongruent or dissimilar stimuli at full contrast gave rise to a population dominated by response-suppressing neurons. Our results indicate that V1 dynamically integrates nonvisual sources of information while still attributing most of its resources to coding visual information.",

title     = "Competition and surface conditioning alter the adsorption of phenolic and amino acids on soil minerals",
abstract  = "Adsorptive interactions of organic molecules with soil minerals often impair their bioavailability. However, little is known about the adsorption behaviour of phenolic and nitrogenous compounds on different minerals and their mutual interaction with respect to competition and surface conditioning (i.e. surface modification induced by preceding adsorption of the other class of compounds). Therefore, batch adsorption experiments were done to study the interaction between phenolic acids (PAs; salicylic acid, Sal; syringic acid, Syr; ferulic acid, Fer; vanillic acid, Van) and amino acids (AAs; lysine, Lys; glutamic acid, Glu; leucine, Leu; phenylalanine, Phe) during adsorption on goethite and Ca2+-montmorillonite at pH 6 by applying adsorbate concentrations of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mm. Larger adsorption of PAs was observed on goethite than montmorillonite, whereas the phyllosilicate was a better adsorbent for AAs than the oxide. Among all tested PAs, Sal was preferentially adsorbed on both minerals. For the AAs, Glu was preferentially adsorbed on goethite and Lys on montmorillonite. The AAs were more competitive than PAs and partially suppressed the adsorption of PAs on both minerals. The adsorption of PAs or AAs on both minerals was enhanced by surface conditioning with the other group, with larger effects for goethite than montmorillonite. For goethite, surface conditioning by PAs enhanced the adsorption of AAs more (by 97-161%) than did AAs for PAs (9-48%). The results support the hypothesis that pre-adsorption of one class of organic compound can enhance the retention of another class. This suggests that adsorbed organic matter on soil mineral phases might be subject to a self-strengthening effect. Highlights: Phenolic acids (PAs) were preferentially retained on goethite. Amino acids (AAs) were preferentially retained on montmorillonite. AAs were more competitive than PAs for adsorption sites on both minerals. Pre-adsorption of one class of compound can enhance the retention of another class.",

title     = "Diagnostic accuracy of the use of parental-reported sleep bruxism in a polysomnographic study in children",
abstract  = "Background: Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for sleep bruxism (SB) diagnosis. PSG/SB children's criteria are not available; thus, parental-report SB is widely used. Aim: Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of parental report of sleep tooth grinding (STG) with a PSG/SB diagnosis in children, adopting adult criteria. Design: Thirty-seven children from clinics of Universidad CES were included. Parents filled the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) assessing the single-observation report - CSHQ - of STG with a No/Yes answer and five ordinal answers. A 5-day diary reporting the presence/absence of STG (multiple-observation report) was also completed. Each child underwent a single-night PSG study. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, likelihood ratios, Spearman correlation coefficient, and Cohen's kappa coefficient were used to analyze data. Results: Single observation, using No/Yes answer, showed acceptable specificity and NPV, while low PPV and sensitivity. Accuracy and likelihood ratios were low. When using the five ordinal answers, weak correlation and fair agreement (r = 0.34 and k = 0.40) with PSG/SB adult criteria were found. Multiple-observation evaluation of STG presented moderate correlation and agreement (r = 0.50 and k = 0.48). Conclusions: Although multiple-observation report achieved better agreement than single-observation report, our results failed supporting the validity of report strategies for the diagnosis of SB in children, as an equivalent of PSG/SB adult criteria.",

title     = "Efficient Application of Continuous Fractional Component Monte Carlo in the Reaction Ensemble",
abstract  = "A new formulation of the Reaction Ensemble Monte Carlo technique (RxMC) combined with the Continuous Fractional Component Monte Carlo method is presented. This method is denoted by serial Rx/CFC. The key ingredient is that fractional molecules of either reactants or reaction products are present and that chemical reactions always involve fractional molecules. Serial Rx/CFC has the following advantages compared to other approaches: (1) One directly obtains chemical potentials of all reactants and reaction products. Obtained chemical potentials can be used directly as an independent check to ensure that chemical equilibrium is achieved. (2) Independent biasing is applied to the-fractional molecules of reactants and reaction products. Therefore, the efficiency of the algorithm is significantly increased, compared to the other approaches. (3) Changes in the maximum scaling parameter of intermolecular interactions can be chosen differently for reactants and reaction products. (4) The number of fractional molecules is reduced. As a proof of principle, our method is tested for Lennard-Jones systems at various pressures and for various chemical reactions. Excellent agreement was found both for average densities and equilibrium mixture compositions computed using serial Rx/CFC, RxMC/CFCMC previously introduced by Rosch and Maginn (Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 2011, 7, 269-279), and the conventional RxMC approach. The serial Rx/CFC approach is also tested for the reaction of ammonia synthesis at various temperatures and pressures. Excellent agreement was found between results obtained from serial Rx/CFC, experimental results from literature, and thermodynamic modeling using the Peng Robinson equation of state. The efficiency of reaction trial moves is improved by a factor of 2 to 3 (depending on the system) compared to the RxMC/CFCMC formulation by Rosch and Maginn.",

title     = "Global incidence of oral and oropharynx cancer in patients younger than 45 years versus older patients: A systematic review",
abstract  = "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is typically regarded as a disease of elderly people. However, increasing numbers of patients worldwide with HNSCC at younger age (defined as --45 years old) have been reported in recent years. To assess geographical variations and trends worldwide in incidence of oral and oropharyngeal cancer in young patients, a systematic review was conducted in PubMed and Google scholar databases from 1975 to June 2016. Seventy-eight studies were selected for further study. Nineteen population-based studies on incidence rate were available from 13 countries, showing a prominent increase over time except for the Netherlands. A notable rise of oral (mobile) tongue cancer among white women and oropharyngeal cancer in white men was observed. Data suggest that cancer in young patients may be a distinct clinical entity and characterised by different aetiology and pathogenesis. Additionally, the relative proportion of oral and oropharyngeal cancer in young patients to total incidence revealed a significant difference between estimates from North America (5.5%) and both Africa (17.2%) and Middle East (14.5%). It is concluded that (i) a rising trend in oral and oropharynx cancers is observed in young patients worldwide; (ii) incidence studies should properly define outcomes in age cohorts and use a consensus cut-off for young patients; (iii) more population-based studies should be performed in non-Western regions to get accurate global measures of incidence for these cancers in young subpopulations and (iv) there is an urge to identify new aetiological factors in these young patients.",

abstract  = "The Dutch system for subsidised legal aid differs from the systems in Finland and Scotland because of, among other things, the separation of primary and secondary legal aid. Legal services counters may be able to reduce costs by having private lawyers provide consultations. Increasing the importance of legal expenses insurance leads to a transferral of public to private costs and may also harm the universal accessibility of legal aid within the Netherlands.The Netherlands has a system for subsidised legal aid that is characterised by access through legalservices counters and a separation between primary and secondary legal aid. Other countries haveestablished a different structure for the system. Recently, there has been discussion about the needto restructure the system for legal aid in the Netherlands. The Ministry of Security and Justice askedSEO Amsterdam Economics to investigate this matter. To this end, the system of the Netherlandsshall be compared to the systems adopted in Finland and Scotland. SEO will also examine theextent to which the measures taken in these countries can be implemented in the system for legalaid in the Netherlands and the cost implications this may entail.The question that is central to this report is what can be learned from investigating the systems forsubsidised legal aid in the Netherlands, Finland, and Scotland, with regard to the efficiency of theDutch system for subsidised legal aid. This question will be answered by means of two specificscenarios. Firstly, in what ways will the costs of the Dutch system for subsidised legal aid be affectedby using lawyers to provide primary legal aid services? Secondly, in what ways will the costs of theDutch system for subsidised legal aid be affected by the use of legal expenses insurance?Comparing the systems of the Netherlands, Finland, and ScotlandCompared to Finland and Scotland, the primary and secondary forms of legal aid are more clearlyseparated in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, legal action is only taken by privately employedlawyers, while in Finland and (to a lesser extent) in Scotland, this is done by public lawyers as well.In Scotland, privately employed lawyers perform activities that are, in the Netherlands, mainly performed by lower-qualified (and therefore cheaper) professionals working at legal services counters.The Dutch system for subsidised legal aid is more expensive per capita than the Finnish systemand less expensive per capita than the Scottish system. The costs per legal aid certificate in theNetherlands are lower than the costs per dispute in Finland, and approximately equal to the costsper dispute in Scotland.Determining the efficiency of the different systems has turned out to be quite complicated. This ismainly due to differences in definitions, institutional differences, and missing data. In order toclarify we have opted to work out the details of a divorce case. Even while working out this case,there turned out to be such great differences between the countries, that it is next to impossible toreach an integral quantitative judgement on the efficiency of the Dutch system. Nonetheless, it isevidenced by the case that the costs of subsidised legal aid for a similar divorce case in Scotlandare higher than in the Netherlands; that for relatively simple divorce cases, people less often appealfor subsidised legal aid in Finland than they do in the Netherlands; and that in the Netherlands, thelowest incomes pay a higher contribution compared to Finland and Scotland.Scenario 1 -lawyers providing primary legal aidIn order to reinforce the primary form of aid, legal services counters can employ lawyers or havelawyers from private organisations provide consultations. These lawyers should focus on the disputes that are solvable without going to court but which are slightly too complex in the currentsituation for the professionals who work at legal services counters. This way the number of referralsto the secondary form of aid and the related costs can be limited. After all, lawyers who work forlegal services counters and receive a fixed compensation have a lower production stimulus thanlawyers who provide secondary legal aid services in the current situation, provided that the lawyerswho work for legal services counters cannot refer cases to their own private organisations.Scenario 2 - increasing the share of legal expenses insuranceIncreasing the share of legal expenses insurance is estimated to affect approximately thirty percentof the disputes for which an appeal to subsidised legal aid is made. These are the disputes that areinsurable; most of the disputes for which people use subsidized legal aid are not insurable. Theimplementation of this policy is analysed in three ways: the insurable disputes can be excluded fromsubsidised legal aid, it can be made mandatory to make use of alternative forms of legal aid, andthe contributions for insurable disputes can be increased. All three variations lead to 'a' saving ofpublic resources and a transferral of public to private costs, but to what extent is hard to say.Implementing scenarios in the NetherlandsScenario 1 - lawyers providing primary legal aidLegal services counters that want to make use of the services of currently private lawyers for primary legal aid can do this in two ways. They can offer one or several lawyers an employmentcontract, for instance for a certain hours a week or on the basis of a zero hour contract. Or theycan hire (one or several) lawyers' services for periodic consultation. The second option seems preferable as it provides more flexibility for legal services counters and it avoids issues of lawyer'sindependence.Scenario 2 - increasing the share of legal expenses insuranceThere are no practical reasons why the share of legal expenses insurance cannot be increased. Notissuing or increasing the costs of additions for insurable disputes can cause people who seek justiceto forgo legal aid. It is questionable whether this is socially acceptable. The ones who make use ofsubsidised legal aid in the current situation mostly have a low income. Their options and willingnessfor taking out a legal expenses insurance are probably limited. Similar arguments can be made whenthe contributions for insurable disputes were to rise substantially. People will not be able to affordthis extra contribution. Finally, the implementation of the obligation to make use of other formsof legal aid will have little consequence if there is no central registration. As long as appeals canalso be made to subsidised legal aid, the financial stimulus to report will not increase because ofthis policy change.Limitations concerning the determination of the consequences of scenariosWhen working out the effects of the implementation of these scenarios in the Netherlands, limitations arise. The lack of a clear connection between the efforts and the result, the lack of integral data on costs and advantages, and the different ways in which the systems of legal aid are structured in the Netherlands, Scotland, and Finland, make it impossible to perform a definite quantitative impact assessment. Because of this, the calculations in this study are based on assumptions that are validated on the basis of the available numbers, literature, and the interviews that were conducted with experts in the three countries. The results of these calculations thus indicate an impact direction, while the precise scope of the reported effects is less clear.",

abstract  = "Monitoring lipid oxidation during the shelf life of lipid-containing food emulsions, such as mayonnaise, is challenging. It is, however, essential for the development of improved, consumer-preferred products. Determining the nonvolatile lipid oxidation products (NONVOLLOPS), the precursor compounds for rancidity, is required to determine the effectiveness of product stabilization technologies. A method based on normal-phase liquid chromatography with atmospheric pressure photo ionization-mass spectrometry (LC APPI-MS) was developed for this purpose. The inclusion of a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) step was needed to remove interfering diacylglycerides and free fatty acids from the samples. The combined SEC and normal-phase LC-APPI-MS method allowed the identification of a wide range of oxidized species including hydroperoxides, oxo-2(1/2) glycerides, epoxides, and other oxidized species. The method was found to be more suitable for the analysis of large sample sets. The relative levels of NONVOLLOPS from both ambient and accelerated stability tests could be determined. The results were compared to hexanal measurements. The data showed that NONVOLLOPS predict the rancidity of different formulations in a much earlier stage during shelf-life tests, providing valuable information for future product development.",

The pathway through which a mixture of tri-n-octylamine (TOA) and hydrogen chloride (HCl), rather than di-n-octylamine (DOA) and 1-chlorooctane, are produced has been determined through transition state (TS) search with Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculations. Particularly, strong agreement between the experimental FTIR spectra and that of TOA demonstrates the same result for the first time. Moreover, the thermal dissociation of TOAHCl proceeds in two continuous steps, which is different from the low molecular mass amine hydrochlorides. The experimental enthalpy of the dissociation was 70.793 with DSC measurement which is very close to the density functional theory (DFT) calculation result 69.395 . Furthermore, with the aid of DFT calculations, some other important thermochemical characteristics such as crystal lattice energy with the value of 510.597 were evaluated by means of Born-Fajans-Haber cycle. The thermal dissociation of tri-n-octylamine hydrochloride was investigated with both the quantum chemical simulation and experimental methods. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations suggest that the products are tri-n-octylamine and HCl rather than di-n-octylamine and 1-chlorooctane.

However, to take advantage of this peculiar property, it is necessary to control and measure the ensemble orientation of the host particles with a high degree of precision. Here, we show a methodology to obtain the photoluminescence polarization of Eu-doped LaPO4 nanorods assembled in an electrically modulated liquid-crystalline phase. We measure Eu3+ emission spectra for the three main optical configurations (sigma, pi and alpha, depending on the direction of observation and the polarization axes) and use them as a reference for the nanorod orientation analysis. Based on the fact that flowing nanorods tend to orient along the shear strain profile, we use this orientation analysis to measure the local shear rate in a flowing liquid. The potential of this approach is then demonstrated through tomographic imaging of the shear rate distribution in a microfluidic system.",

The vesicle size, encapsulation efficiency, polydispersity index, and zeta potentials of purposed formula were 93.61 nm, 82.8%, 0.14, and -23, respectively. Vesicles were round-shaped and smooth-surfaced entities with sharp boundaries.

title     = "Newton flows for elliptic functions II: Structural stability: classification and representation",
abstract  = "In our previous paper we associated to each non-constant elliptic function f on a torus T a dynamical system, the elliptic Newton flow corresponding to f. We characterized the functions for which these flows are structurally stable and showed a genericity result. In the present paper we focus on the classification and representation of these structurally stable flows. The phase portrait of a structurally stable elliptic Newton flow generates a connected, cellularly embedded graph G(f) on a torus T with r vertices, 2r edges and r faces that fulfil certain combinatorial properties (Euler, Hall) on some of its subgraphs. The graph G(f) determines the conjugacy class of the flow [classification]. A connected, cellularly embedded toroidal graph G with the above Euler and Hall properties, is called a Newton graph. Any Newton graph G can be realized as the graph G(f) of the structurally stable Newton flow for some function f. This leads to: up till conjugacy between flows and (topological) equivalency between graphs, there is a one to one correspondence between the structurally stable Newton flows and Newton graphs, both with respect to the same order r of the underlying functions f [representation]. Finally, we clarify the analogy between rational and elliptic Newton flows, and show that the detection of elliptic Newton flows is possible in polynomial time. The proofs of the above results rely on Peixoto's characterization/classification theorems for structurally stable dynamical systems on compact 2-dimensional manifolds, Stiemke's theorem of the alternatives, Hall's theorem of distinct representatives, the Heffter-Edmonds-Ringer rotation principle for embedded graphs, an existence theorem on gradient dynamical systems by Smale, and an interpretation of Newton flows as steady streams.",

abstract  = "The linear solvent strength model was used to predict coverage in online comprehensive two-dimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The prediction model uses a parallelogram to describe the separation space covered with peaks in a system with limited orthogonality. The corners of the parallelogram are assumed to behave like chromatographic peaks and the position of these pseudo-compounds was predicted. A mix of 25 polycyclic aromatic compounds were used as a test. The precision of the prediction, span 0-25, was tested by varying input parameters, and was found to be acceptable with root mean square errors of 3. The accuracy of the prediction was assessed by comparing with the experimental coverages. Less than half of experimental coverages were outside prediction +/- 1 x root mean square error and none outside prediction +/- 2 x root mean square error. Accuracy was lower when retention factors were low, or when gradient conditions affected parameters not included in the model, e.g. second dimension gradient time affects the second dimension equilibration time. The concept shows promise as a tool for gradient optimization in online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography, as it mitigates the tedious registration and modeling of all sample constituents, a circumstance that is particularly appealing when dealing with complex samples.",

The resin is prepared by polymerising glycerol, the simplest trialcohol, with citric acid, the simplest abundantly available triacid. Mixing these two chemicals at moderate temperatures begins a multi-step esterification that results in a network-like resin foam. The hardness, brittleness, and toughness of this resin can be controlled by changing the alcohol : acid ratio, the temperature, and the presence of additives. Remarkably, this resin is fully biodegradable, breaking down to its molecular components in water. The degradation period can be varied from a few days to a few months, depending on the degree of polymerisation. We have prepared over 800 different formulations of this new material, which is now being produced on the ton scale by Plantics BV in The Netherlands under the trade names Glycix and Plantics-GX. This resin is made from inexpensive and widely available starting materials. It is 100% biobased, non-toxic and biodegradable.

title     = "Product shape selectivity of MFI-type, MEL-type, and BEA-type zeolites in the catalytic hydroconversion of heptane",
abstract  = "The influence of product shape selectivity on the bifunctional conversion of n-C-7 by zeolite catalysts is investigated. Three different zeolite catalysts with different pore sizes (MFI-type, MEL-type, and BEA-type zeolites) have been investigated experimentally. For all three catalysts, n-C-7 is isomerized to mono-branched isomers which are further isomerized into dibranched isomers, and these dibranched molecules are converted into cracking products. More dibranched isomers and less cracking products are produced by BEA-type zeolite compared to MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites and clear differences are observed in the distribution of dibranched isomers produced by different catalysts. Molecular simulation is used to compute the adsorption isotherms and free energy barriers for diffusion of dibranched isomers in MFI-type, MEL-type, and BEA-type zeolites. Combining simulation results and experimental observations, it is shown that product shape selectivity can explain the distribution of dibranched molecules while transition state shape selectivity fails to do so. For the medium-pore zeolites (MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites), free energy barriers for diffusion of dibranched molecules are significant. For MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites, the dibranched molecule that has to overcome lower diffusion barrier is produced with a higher yield and the distribution of dimethylpentane molecules is determined by their diffusion rate. It is shown that there is almost no free energy barrier for the diffusion of any of these molecules in BEA-type zeolite. As BEA-type zeolite imposes no free energy barrier for diffusion of any of dibranched isomers, the distribution of dibranched isomers is very close to the equilibrium distribution in the gas phase. Due to the limited mobility of dimethylpentanes within the pores of MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites, most of the dimethylpentane molecules are trapped inside the zeolite and undergo consecutive cracking. Dimethylpentane molecules diffuse sufficiently fast in the large pores of BEA-type zeolite and transfer to the gas phase, before consecutive reaction converts these molecules into cracking products. Moreover, the effect of the MFI-type crystal size on the production of dibranched isomers is investigated. The yield of dibranched isomers reduces by increasing the size of the crystal and larger part of dibranched isomers are cracked as the crystal size of MFI-type is increased. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract  = "Firms trade-off CFOs' fiduciary duties against their decision-making duties when designing CFO bonus plans. Decreasing bonus incentives tied to financial measures benefits CFOs' fiduciary responsibilities at the expense of motivating their decision making duties. As prior research indicates that clawbacks increase personal misreporting costs through the loss of previously awarded compensation, we examine whether clawbacks allow firms to increase incentives in CFO bonus contracts. Based on a sample of U.S. firms between 2007 and 2013, we find that clawbacks are associated with greater CFO bonus incentives. We also find the increase in incentives to be more pronounced for CFOs relative to other executives. Our results are moderated by firms' susceptibility to misreporting. The relation between clawbacks and incentives is weaker when firms experienced internal control deficiencies, have larger abnormal accruals, when CFOs are more vulnerable to pressure from CEOs, and when audit committees have less financial expertise and prestige.",

title    = "Why Multilingualism and Multilingual Communication Jeopardize a Common Social Policy for Europe",
abstract = "This paper studies the consequences of European multilingualism and multilingual communication for a common social policy in the Europe Union. In the past fifty years, the main focus of the Europeanization project has been on financial-economic developments and less on a common social policy. Even today, there is no common framework for social protection in the European Union. Common minimum income or wages for European citizens are lacking. In this paper, it will be argued that the lack of social protection has to do with Europe's linguistic diversity. Language is seen as a building block of national communities and their political cultures. The European integration project can only continue if different European political cultures are shared. However, due to the fact that a neutral lingua franca is lacking, this has been unsuccessful so far. The interaction of social groups that have a different language repertoire with the structures of multilevel governance are responsible for the fact that some of these social groups, including the 'Eurostars', and national cosmopolitans benefit from social protection, whereas other groups lacking relevant language skills, such as anti-establishment forces, commoners, and migrants, are excluded from the European power domains. These power configurations can be fruitfully studied in the floral figuration model. Consequently, due to these patterns of inclusion and exclusion, true solidarity among European citizens is not within reach. These claims will be illustrated by a case study on the Netherlands, a country that has been pursuing neoliberal policies counterbalancing Eurozone and economic crises and is trying to assimilate migrants and other newcomers. Apart from assimilatory policies targeting migrants, language games used by competing forces are playing an important role in the discourse in order to set up power structures.",

These can only be estimated in a reliable way from a sufficiently large historical dataset for such portfolios, which is often not available. We overcome this problem by introducing a model to estimate portfolio-specific mortality simultaneously with population mortality. By using a Bayesian framework, we automatically generate the appropriate weighting for the limited statistical information in a given portfolio and the more extensive information that is available for the whole population. This allows us to separate parameter uncertainty from uncertainty due to the randomness in individual deaths for a given realization of mortality rates. When we apply our method to a dataset of assured lives in England and Wales, we find that different prior specifications for the portfolio-specific factors lead to significantly different posterior distributions for hazard rates. However, in short-term predictive distributions for future numbers of deaths, individual mortality risk turns out to be more important than parameter uncertainty in the portfolio-specific factors, both for large and for small portfolios.",

abstract = "Manufacturing enterprises are increasingly more aware of the importance of establishing collaborative relationships with their network partners, due to the advantages associated to collaboration. Nevertheless, the participation in a collaborative network (CN) comes with associated challenges, namely the need to reduce the potential for conflicts among partners. A CN consists of heterogeneous partners, each one defining its own objectives and activating its own strategies. In this context, the ability to quickly identify partners with aligned strategies is crucial for smooth operation of the CN. The main aim of this paper is to address the partners' selection problem in the context of Virtual organizations Breeding Environments (VBE) that facilitate and enable the creation of Virtual Organisations (VO), as one type of CN. In a first stage, the sets of enterprises, characterised by having the required competencies to create the VO, are identified among different potential candidates within the VBE. In a second stage, the strategies alignment approach, based on the system dynamics simulation method, is used for the partners' selection process, identifying the best set of enterprises. In this paper, the final stage of partners' selection process is addressed by obtaining the degree of alignment of the business strategies formulated by each set of enterprises. In the light of this, a system dynamics-simulation model, in AnyLogic, is presented to obtain the set of enterprises that have higher levels of alignment in its strategies. The proposed system dynamics-simulation model is applied to a case in the building industry, to deal with the partners' selection problem in a VBE with the aim of forming a stable and sustainable VO.",

One important question thereby is what characterizes and explains the interactions of non-state advocates with policymakers. In order to clarify this matter, we analyse the advocacy strategies of non-state actors, more precisely whether and why they address opponents instead of more like-minded policymakers. For this purpose, we analyse evidence collected through 228 interviews with advocates who attended the WTO Ministerial Conferences (Geneva 2012) and the United Nations Climate Conferences (Durban 2011; Doha 2012). Our results show that transnational advocates predominantly target like-minded policymakers and that their activities are much less focused on their opponents. Variation in advocacy towards opponents or like-minded policymakers is explained by the alignment of non-state actors with policymakers, the salience of topics on the political agenda, group characteristics, and whether or not advocates hail from democratic countries.",

abstract  = "In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric TV-AR model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the TV-AR model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the TV-AR model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology.",

abstract  = "This paper questions under what conditions the social foundation necessary for the construction and sustenance of civil society are present in post-colonial social formations, and the extent to which there has been a need to develop concessionary politics to maintain a project of rule. It utilizes Partha Chatterjee's usage of Gramsci's political society to understand how Cambodia's ILO-led garment factory monitoring regime secures legitimacy not by the participation of worker citizens in the matters of the state, but by claiming to provide for their well being. I argue that the hegemonic project is fraught by virtue of the fact that consent-seeking forms of regulation, which aim to prevent strikes through trade union membership and tripartitism, have reached their limit and spilled over and into a disaggregated, messier terrain of struggles akin to political society. To develop the argument that workers' politics cannot be expressed in state-civil society relations, I present case studies of two forms of protest. The first form is distinguished by mass faintings, which I characterize as 'visceral protest' against the terms of workers' insertion into industrial capitalism. The second is large-scale, worker-led strikes that signal a 'politics of social disorder' is emerging, characterized by extra-legal, disruptive, and sometimes violent protest. The paper calls for a re-politicization of labor, and research attuned to workers' ambitions that cannot be reduced to a stable location or sphere within state-civil society relations.",

title     = "Color vision predicts processing modes of goal activation during action cascading",
abstract  = "One of the most important functions of cognitive control is action cascading: the ability to cope with multiple response options when confronted with various task goals. A recent study implicates a key role for dopamine (DA) in this process, suggesting higher D1 efficiency shifts the action cascading strategy toward a more serial processing mode, whereas higher D2 efficiency promotes a shift in the opposite direction by inducing a more parallel processing mode (Stock, Arning, Epplen, & Beste, 2014). Given that DA is found in high concentration in the retina and modulation of retinal DA release displays characteristics of D2-receptors (Peters, Schweibold, Przuntek, & Muller, 2000), color vision discrimination might serve as an index of D2 efficiency. We used color discrimination, assessed with the Lanthony Desaturated Panel D-15 test, to predict individual differences (N = 85) in a stop-change paradigm that provides a well-established measure of action cascading. In this task it is possible to calculate an individual slope value for each participant that estimates the degree of overlap in task goal activation. When the stopping process of a previous task goal has not finished at the time the change process towards a new task goal is initiated (parallel processing), the slope value becomes steeper. In case of less overlap (more serial processing), the slope value becomes flatter. As expected, participants showing better color vision were more prone to activate goals in a parallel manner as indicated by a steeper slope. Our findings suggest that color vision might represent a predictor of D2 efficiency and the predisposed processing mode of goal activation during action cascading.",

abstract  = "Emotion instability in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with an impaired fronto-limbic inhibitory network. However, functional connectivity (FC) underlying altered emotion regulation in BPD has yet to be established. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to investigate enduring effects of effortful emotion regulation on the amygdala intrinsic FC in BPD. In this multicenter study, resting-state fMRI was acquired before and after an emotion regulation task in 48 BPD patients and 39 non-patient comparison individuals. The bilateral amygdalae were used as a seed in the whole-brain FC analysis and two-way mixed ANOVA to test whether BPD patients exhibited weaker post-task increase in the amygdala intrinsic FC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), compared to non-patients. Subsequently, we explored whether the results are common for personality disorders characterized by emotional problems, using additional data of 21 cluster-C personality disorder patients. In contrast to non-patients, BPD patients failed to show increased post-task amygdala resting-state FC with the medial, dorsolateral, ventrolateral PFC, and superior temporal gyrus, but surprisingly exhibited decreased FC with the posterior cingulate cortex and increased FC with the superior parietal lobule. In BPD patients, the emotion regulation task failed to increase resting-state amygdala FC with brain regions essential for effortful emotion regulation, which suggests: (a) altered cognitive control typically used to indirectly alleviate distress by reinterpreting the meaning of emotional stimuli; (b) impaired direct regulation of emotional responses, which might be common for personality disorders; (c) avoidance of self-related appraisals induced by social emotional stimuli.",

In our analysis, we discern between actual and perceived characteristics of media attention.

A survey was conducted to analyze the perceptions of coverage and mass media orientations of Dutch communication professionals working for those organizations. For public organizations, actual media favorability and perceived visibility turned out to be important predictors of the media orientation 'attention seeking'. The organizations were rather homogeneous in their relations between actual and perceived media coverage and the media orientation 'strategic impact'. This orientation was best predicted by volume of coverage, the substantiality of issues that were covered, and perceived visibility.

abstract  = "Efficient delivery of anti-dandruff (AD) actives into the scalp follicular infundibulum as well as onto the scalp surface is critical for the efficacy of AD shampoos. A method involving scalp cyanoacrylate (CA) biopsy sampling, a tailor made cutting device, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement and Raman imaging has been developed for the measurement of delivery of zinc pyrithione (ZPT) and climbazole (CBZ) from an AD shampoo into the scalp follicular infundibulum. Scalp CA biopsy enables the sampling of ZPT and CBZ delivered into the scalp follicular infundibula as well as onto the scalp surface. Raman imaging of scalp CA biopsy samples allows the visualization of the spatial distribution of ZPT and CBZ deposited on the scalp. A tailor made cutting device enables the separation of the scalp follicular infundibulum sample (20 pm below the scalp surface) from the scalp surface samples (including top 20 pm of infundibula). UHPLC-MS/MS was used as a sensitive and specific methodology enabling the quantification of ZPT and CBZ without interference. Using this method, both ZPT and CBZ were successfully quantified and spatially visualized within the scalp follicular infundibulum, after scalp was washed with an AD shampoo. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

abstract  = "Connectivity analysis is performed on a long financial record of 21 international stock indices employing a linear and a nonlinear causality measure, the conditional Granger causality index (CGCI) and the partial mutual information on mixed embedding (PMIME), respectively. Both measures aim to specify the direction of the interrelationships among the international stock indexes and portray the links of the resulting networks, by the presence of direct couplings between variables exploiting all available information. However, their differences are assessed due to the presence of nonlinearity. The weighted networks formed with respect to the causality measures are transformed to binary ones using a significance test. The financial networks are formed on sliding windows in order to examine the network characteristics and trace changes in the connectivity structure. Subsequently, two statistical network quantities are calculated; the average degree and the average shortest path length. The empirical findings reveal interesting time-varying properties of the constructed network, which are clearly dependent on the nature of the financial cycle.",

This also suggests that there may be applications for which current 'imperfect' EL is already very useful, and makes finding the 'right' application as important as building the 'right' EL system. We investigate the Digital Humanities use case, where scholars spend a considerable amount of time selecting relevant source texts. We developed WideNet; a semantically-enhanced search tool which leverages the strengths of (imperfect) EL without getting in the way of its expert users. We evaluate this tool in two historical case-studies aiming to collect a set of references to historical periods in parliamentary debates from the last two decades; the first targeted the Dutch Golden Age, and the second World War II. The case-studies conclude with a critical reflection on the utility of WideNet for this kind of research, after which we outline how such a real-world application can help to improve EL technology in general.",

abstract  = "Research summary: Limited attention has been paid to the crucial role of individuals' motivation and social interactions in capability development. Building on literature in social psychology and behavioral economics that links heterogeneity in individual social motives to social interactions, we explain how the variation, selection, and retention processes underlying a group's deliberate capability development are affected by the composition of the group in terms of individuals' social motives in interplay with the organizational-level motivational levers designed by managers. Our multilevel theoretical model suggests that individual-level heterogeneity leads to the development of capabilities along different paths. For practice, this implies that, according to the composition of the group in terms of social motives, capabilities are more or less technically and evolutionary adequate and a source of business process performance.Managerial summary:We propose that when a group of employees engages in developing one of the firm's capabilities, capability development will follow a different path according to what motivates most of the employees composing the group. We identify and discuss three paths. Two of these paths (convergence and congruence) can help improve business process performance in a stable environment, the third one (open-ended) in a dynamic environment. Our work invites managers to not only think in terms of more or less capability development, but also in terms of capability development path(s): the path(s) in which groups in the firm are currently engaged and the one(s) that are desirable given the firm's objectives and the nature of the environment(s) the firm faces in deploying its business processes.",

title     = "Housing preferences among students: collective housing versus individual accommodations? A stated preference study in Antwerp (Belgium)",
abstract  = "Collective housing or cohousing has gained popularity in the housing market because it promotes social, economic and environmental sustainability, and contributes to a better quality of life. While young professionals are increasingly choosing for peer-shared housing, student expectations are increasing with regard to personal space and comfort. Following the massive expansion of the student population, private sector developers have recently become more involved in the student accommodation market providing high standard expensive single person flats. Responding to a lack of attention to student housing preferences in both student housing and cohousing research, this study aims to discover housing preferences of Belgian students with a focus on the relative importance they attach to private versus shared amenities. We carried out a stated preference experiment among students in higher education in Antwerp. Our results show that the main point of interest for the majority of the students is the type of housing, followed by rent and size. Regarding the type of housing, a studio flat is the most preferred accommodation, while living in a student room in the same house as the landlord the least preferred. Hence, our results show a high preference for private facilities. We conclude that private investors are actually responding to current student preferences. As their high standard student housing projects are easy to construct, maintain and organise, we expect more of them in the near future. However, the willingness to pay of university students is significantly lower than that of university college students who study 1 or 2 years less. Consequently, a demand for a diversified student housing market will presumably persist.",

abstract  = "Phytohormones, such as salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA), play key roles in plant defence following pathogen attack. The involvement of these hormones in susceptibility following Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) infection has mostly been studied in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, Fo causes vascular wilt disease in a broad range of crops, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Surprisingly little is known about the involvement of these phytohormones in the susceptibility of tomato towards Fo f. sp. lycopersici (Fol). Here, we investigate their involvement by the analysis of the expression of ET, JA and SA marker genes following Fol infection, and by bioassays of tomato mutants affected in either hormone production or perception. Fol inoculation triggered the expression of SA and ET marker genes, showing the activation of these pathways. NahG tomato, in which SA is degraded, became hypersusceptible to Fol infection and showed stronger disease symptoms than wild-type. In contrast, ACD and Never ripe (Nr) mutants, in which ET biosynthesis and perception, respectively, are impaired, showed decreased disease symptoms and reduced fungal colonization on infection. The susceptibility of the def1 tomato mutant, and a prosystemin over-expressing line, in which JA signalling is compromised or constitutively activated, respectively, was unaltered. Our results show that SA is a negative and ET a positive regulator of Fol susceptibility. The SA and ET signalling pathways appear to act synergistically, as an intact ET pathway is required for the induction of an SA marker gene, and vice versa.",

abstract  = "This paper considers the problem of a lifelong health insurance cover where medical inflation is not sufficiently incorporated in the level premium determined at policy issue. We focus on the setting where changes in health benefits, driven by medical inflation, are accounted for by an appropriate update or indexation of the level premium, the policy value, or both premium and policy value, during the term of the contract. Such an updating mechanism is necessary to restore the actuarial equivalence between future health benefits and surrender values on the one hand, and available policy values and future premiums on the other hand. We extend existing literature (Vercruysse et al., 2013; Denuit et al., 2017) by developing updating mechanisms in a discrete-time framework, where medical inflation is only taken into account ex-post as it emerges over time and where surrender values are allowed for. We propose and design two types of surrender values: based on the ageing provision on the one hand and based directly on the premiums paid until surrender on the other hand. We illustrate our updating strategy with numerical examples, using Belgian data, and investigate the sensitivity of our findings with respect to elements from the technical basis (in particular: the lapse rates) used in the actuarial calculations. Our updating mechanism is generic and useful for a wide range of products in life and health insurance, where some elements of the technical basis are guaranteed while others are subject to revision according to policy conditions.",

Within the parent-child relationship, mind-mindedness relates to parents' sensitive caregiving, and to children's secure attachment. However, the same relations are still unexplored in out-of-home care settings. We investigated the associations between childcare professionals' mind-mindedness, sensitive responsiveness and respect for autonomy, and child-caregiver attachment security. Moreover, we examined whether these relations are influenced by caregivers' and children's gender. Participants were 17 caregiver couples (17 males, 17 females) and 34 three-year-old children (17 boys, 17 girls), recruited in childcare centers. Mind-mindedness toward the boy or the girl (dyadic) or both children (non-dyadic), sensitive responsiveness and respect for autonomy were assessed during a semi-structured play. Attachment security was assessed through observations. Male and female caregivers had equivalent scores of mind-mindedness, sensitive responsiveness, and respect for autonomy. Similarly, children were securely attached to male and female caregivers. Girls' and boys' secure attachment was predicted by caregivers' use of non-dyadic mind-related comments. For girls, but not for boys, the relation was partially mediated by caregivers' respect for autonomy. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance for the quality of child-caregiver relationships, and children's socio-emotional development.",

abstract  = "Mardels are defined as closed depressions with a diameter of 10-50 m and a depth of 1-3 m. The genesis of mardels has been studied intensively, inside and outside Luxembourg. In research reports published before 2000, a natural genesis has been frequently suggested. Because of the Post Roman datings of sedimentary infills of mardel, researchers suggested in more recent publications also the possibility of anthropogenic causes. This study discusses the natural versus anthropogenic genesis of mardels on the Luxembourger Gutland plateau. Here, mardels occur on Lias and Keuper marlstone. In the present landscape most mardels are shallow fens, filled with clayey colluvial sediments. These sedimentary infills are valuable soil archives, but palaeoecological analysis of mardel cores cannot disentangle the natural versus anthropogenic genesis of mardels. Provenance analysis can link the finds of Roman ceramics in the neighborhood of mardels to the applied source materials. The results of geochemical analysis by WD-XRF indicates that clay, extracted from mardels and soils around the mardels, was used for the Gallo-Roman ceramic 'industry'. Most probably, the clay winning started in moist depression, on the Lias marls related to the underlying pattern of joints in the Luxembourger sandstone, on the Keuper marls related to subsurface dissolutions of gypsum lenses and veins filled with colluvial clay. Due to the clay winning, the natural depressions have been enlarged to the present mardels. In abandoned quarries, the sedimentation of clayey colluvium could restart.",

abstract  = "Online shops could offer each website customer a different price. Such personalized pricing can lead to advanced forms of price discrimination based on individual characteristics of consumers, which may be provided, obtained, or assumed. An online shop can recognize customers, for instance through cookies, and categorize them as price-sensitive or price-insensitive. Subsequently, it can charge (presumed) price-insensitive people higher prices. This paper explores personalized pricing from a legal and an economic perspective. From an economic perspective, there are valid arguments in favour of price discrimination, but its effect on total consumer welfare is ambiguous. Irrespectively, many people regard personalized pricing as unfair or manipulative. The paper analyses how this dislike of personalized pricing may be linked to economic analysis and to other norms or values. Next, the paper examines whether European data protection law applies to personalized pricing. Data protection law applies if personal data are processed, and this paper argues that that is generally the case when prices are personalized. Data protection law requires companies to be transparent about the purpose of personal data processing, which implies that they must inform customers if they personalize prices. Subsequently, consumers have to give consent. If enforced, data protection law could thereby play a significant role in mitigating any adverse effects of personalized pricing. It could help to unearth how prevalent personalized pricing is and how people respond to transparency about it.",

abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Partial tooth agenesis is frequently observed in Robin sequence. Tooth anomalies are increasingly considered as an extended phenotype of the cleft palate population. The study objective was to compare the prevalence and patterns of tooth agenesis in a group of patients with non-syndromic Robin sequence (ns-RS) and a group with non-syndromic cleft palate (ns-CP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The panoramic radiographs of 115 ns-RS and 191 ns-CP patients were assessed for agenesis of the permanent dentition (excluding third molars) and the patterns recorded using the Tooth Agenesis Code.RESULTS: Partial tooth agenesis was observed in 47.8% of ns-RS and 29.8% of ns-CP patients with a greater prevalence in the mandibula than in the maxilla, particularly in ns-RS. The teeth most frequently absent in both groups were the mandibular second premolars and maxillary lateral incisors. Tooth agenesis was bilateral in two-thirds of affected ns-RS patients and one-half of ns-CP patients. In ns-RS, bilateral agenesis of the mandibular second premolars was more frequently observed in female than that in male patients. Completely symmetrical patterns of hypodontia were found in around 45% of ns-RS patients with tooth agenesis compared to 35% in ns-CP. No association was found between the extent of the palatal cleft and the severity of hypodontia.CONCLUSION: Tooth agenesis is more prevalent in ns-RS than that in ns-CP, demonstrates a much greater predilection for the mandible in ns-RS, and bears no relation to the extent of the palatal cleft.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When compared to ns-CP, additional developmental disturbances are likely involved in the etiology of tooth agenesis in ns-RS. Future research could help identify the underlying genetic traits and aid in classifying patients in those with and without expected tooth agenesis in order to facilitate orthodontic management strategies.",

abstract = "As a result of the steep increase in investment arbitrations, and the problems this has brought to the fore, many reform efforts in international investment law focus on changes to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). Reform proposals, however, diverge widely (ranging from exiting the system completely to institutionalizing it further through the creation of an appellate mechanism or a permanent investment court) and do not proceed on the basis of a normative framework that is globally consented. This risks achieving needed systemic reform. The present article sets out the contours of such a normative framework. It suggests that the criticism of ISDS has its origins in frictions with constitutional principles, namely democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Reform proposals, as a consequence, should be developed by reference to principles of (comparative and international) constitutional law. Such a framework can be used to formulate a number of concrete proposals for ISDS reform, in particular increased institutionalization of ISDS and the implementation of other mechanisms that allow states to ensure that ISDS develops in line with the principle of democracy and respect for the rule of law and for the protection of human rights.",

These arrangements present a typical principal-agent problem because they incorporate a 'carrot and stick' approach in which the agent (consortium) has to fulfill the expectations of the principal (procurer). This article deals with a neglected aspect in the literature related to the actual use of 'the sticks or sanctions' in DBFMOs and assesses to what extent and under which conditions contract managers adopt a deterrence-based enforcement approach or switch to a persuasion-based approach, specifically when the contract clauses require the use of (automatic) deterrence. An empirical analysis of four DBFMOs in the Netherlands shows that the continuation of service delivery, the need to build trust, and the lack of agreement on output specifications play a role in the willingness of the procurer to apply a more responsive behavior that uses persuasion, even when deterrence should be automatically applied.",

abstract  = "This study contrasted the effects of tutoring, multiple try and no feedback on children's progression in analogy solving and examined individual differences herein. Feedback that includes additional hints or explanations leads to the greatest learning gains in adults. However, children process feedback differently from adults and effective feedback likely differs between learners with different characteristics or at different stages in the learning process. In this paper multilevel explanatory item response theory models were used to examine individual differences in feedback effects in children's performance on a computerized pretest-training-posttest assessment of analogical reasoning. The role of working memory and ability level, based on initial strategy-use, were examined in a sample of 999 5-10 year-old children who received either tutoring feedback, multiple tries or no feedback during the training sessions. The results indicate that tutoring feedback leads to the greatest performance gains; however, this was moderated by working memory and ability level. Children who initially used less advanced strategies benefited more from each type of feedback than children who used advanced strategies at pretest. Higher working memory scores were linked to greater benefit from tutoring feedback or no feedback, whereas learning gains in the multiple try condition were not related to working memory. The findings of this study contribute to the growing literature on how to personalize feedback to the learner's instructional-needs.",

abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this observational study was to establish the possible presence of confounders on the association between temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and headaches in a patient population from a TMD and Orofacial Pain Clinic.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several subtypes of headaches have been diagnosed: self-reported headache, (probable) migraine, (probable) tension-type headache, and secondary headache attributed to TMD. The presence of TMD was subdivided into 2 subtypes: painful TMD and function-related TMD. The associations between the subtypes of TMD and headaches were evaluated by single regression models. To study the influence of possible confounding factors on this association, the regression models were extended with age, sex, bruxism, stress, depression, and somatic symptoms.RESULTS: Of the included patients (n=203), 67.5% experienced headaches. In the subsample of patients with a painful TMD (n=58), the prevalence of self-reported headaches increased to 82.8%. The associations found between self-reported headache and (1) painful TMD and (2) function-related TMD were confounded by the presence of somatic symptoms. For probable migraine, both somatic symptoms and bruxism confounded the initial association found with painful TMD.DISCUSSION: The findings of this study imply that there is a central working mechanism overlapping TMD and headache. Health care providers should not regard these disorders separately, but rather look at the bigger picture to appreciate the complex nature of the diagnostic and therapeutic process.",

abstract  = "To reduce discrimination and achieve a sustainable integration of an increasingly diverse workforce, organizations invest considerable time and money into diversity training. Despite these efforts, corporate diversity training oftentimes is not effective, as it does not sufficiently enable training participants to constructively deal with diversity. We specify the underlying barriers to learning that may cause diversity training to fail: The trainees' tendency to keep quiet about their thoughts or to voice them in a dogmatic manner, which is likely to lead to latent or manifest conflicts, hindering learning. We also show why the currently dominant diversity-training models--labeled according to their objectives as 'equal opportunities,' 'integrating minorities,' and 'inclusion via 'me' within 'we''--do not suffice to overcome these barriers to learning, largely due to dysfunctional beliefs of the trainers, as these shape learning processes, and thus, training success. Proposing that tolerance acts as a vehicle to overcoming the barriers to learning in diversity training, we introduce a training model focused on fostering tolerance and sustained by tolerance-supportive trainer beliefs. We discuss training measures that could aid the development of tolerance in trainees, limitations of our tolerance-centered diversity training, and venues for future research.",

abstract  = "This paper considers the problem of localizing actions in videos as sequences of bounding boxes. The objective is to generate action proposals that are likely to include the action of interest, ideally achieving high recall with few proposals. Our contributions are threefold. First, inspired by selective search for object proposals, we introduce an approach to generate action proposals from spatiotemporal super-voxels in an unsupervised manner, we call them Tubelets. Second, along with the static features from individual frames our approach advantageously exploits motion. We introduce independent motion evidence as a feature to characterize how the action deviates from the background and explicitly incorporate such motion information in various stages of the proposal generation. Finally, we introduce spatiotemporal refinement of Tubelets, for more precise localization of actions, and pruning to keep the number of Tubelets limited. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach by extensive experiments for action proposal quality and action localization on three public datasets: UCF Sports, MSR-II and UCF101. For action proposal quality, our unsupervised proposals beat all other existing approaches on the three datasets. For action localization, we show top performance on both the trimmed videos of UCF Sports and UCF101 as well as the untrimmed videos of MSR-II.",

We considered an area in the vicinity of the Saint Petersburg Flood Prevention Facility Complex and treat the results as risks on using the model results for the Facility gate operation. We found that model response uncertainty is significant for small waves (Hs -- 0.3 m), and the results variability is moderate ([?] 10 %) for the extreme values of the model prediction. Thus the risk on the use of model results to predict flood threats is low together with visible uncertainty about the prediction of flood start time. Uncertainty in wind velocity has a substantial influence on the model response. In addition, uncertainty in the bathymetry, water level, and breaker index affects model output. Therefore, result uncertainty can be decreased obtaining more certain values of these model inputs.",

title    = "Using semantic feature norms to investigate how the visual and verbal modes afford metaphor construction and expression",
abstract = "In this study, two modalities of expression (verbal and visual) are compared and contrasted, in relation to their ability and their limitations to construct and express metaphors. A representative set of visual metaphors and a representative set of linguistic metaphors are here compared, and the semantic similarity between metaphor terms is modeled within the two sets. Such similarity is operationalized in terms of semantic features produced by informants in a property generation task (e.g., McRae et al., 2005). Semantic features provide insights into conceptual content, and play a role in deep conceptual processing, as opposed to shallow linguistic processing. Thus, semantic features appear to be useful for modeling metaphor comprehension, assuming that metaphors are matters of thought rather than simple figures of speech (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). The question tackled in this paper is whether semantic features can account for the similarity between metaphor terms of both visual and verbal metaphors. For this purpose, a database of semantic features was collected and then used to analyze fifty visual metaphors and fifty verbal metaphors. It was found that the number of semantic features shared between metaphor terms is predicted by the modality of expression of the metaphor: the terms compared in visual metaphors share semantic features, while the terms compared in verbal metaphors do not. This suggests that the two modalities of expression afford different ways to construct and express metaphors.",

Results show that individuals with a divorced sibling had a higher risk of divorce even after correcting for a number of shared background factors, including parental divorce.

In both cases, state-led industrialisation achieved some important social goals, but ultimately proved disappointing and was abandoned in the 1980s. Politicians and planners increasingly emphasised individual entrepreneurship and a more limited role for the state as a path to achieving greater social mobility.

abstract = "Entering the territories of the Third Reich, the Allied 'liberators' were facing incredible deathscapes along the routes of the death marches from the Nazi concentration campsin Poland to German camps like Bergen-Belsen or Dachau. Photography and film convinced the outside world of Germany's collective guilt of war crimes, much like the Nazi's themselves had used photography to convince the world of Soviet war crimes in Katyn and other NKVD massacre sites. This may seem self-evident, as archaeologists are digging for truth and traces, but archaeology has never been an innocent discipline. Stones and bones played a pivotal role in Nazi propaganda as well as in truth finding and presenting evidence for war crime committees. In addition many of these sites have recently become musealized as trauma site museums in which photos and findings are used for visitoridentification.Interestingly, photography, archaeology and forensics play a prominent role in this dynamic of memory. This poses the question how big the impact of former war propagandaand the early visualisation of the camps by means of photography and investigations actually was and how it shaped our image of the 'death camps'. It may also ask for new interpretations of the ethics of representation in Holocaust crime scene investigations and museum exhibitions.Thus transformed from evidence into the material testimonies of the Age of Terror in our current Age of Memory, the confrontation with dead bodies and human remains might have become tabooed in museum contexts, while dark tourism exploits the same atrocities as commodified experiences which as signs of trauma might easily fuel new hatred stirred by media and memory events. This conflicted heritaging of violent pasts asks for a transnational rethinking of Holocaust archaeologies and the politics of display.",

title     = "Bayesian approach to peak deconvolution and library search for high resolution gas chromatography - Mass spectrometry",
abstract  = "A novel probabilistic Bayesian strategy is proposed to resolve highly coeluting peaks in high-resolution GC-MS (Orbitrap) data. Opposed to a deterministic approach, we propose to solve the problem probabilistically,using a complete pipeline. First, the retention time(s) for a (probabilistic) number of compounds for each mass channel are estimated. The statistical dependency between m/z channels was implied by including penalties in the model objective function. Second, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is used as Occam's razor for the probabilistic assessment of the number of components. Third, a probabilistic set of resolved spectra, and their associated retention times are estimated. Finally, a probabilistic library search is proposed, computing the spectral match with a high resolution library. More specifically, a correlative measure was used that included the uncertainties in the least square fitting, as well as the probability for different proposals for the number of compounds in the mixture. The method was tested on simulated high resolution data, as well as on a set of pesticides injected in a GC-Orbitrap with high coelution. The proposed pipeline was able to detect accurately the retention times and the spectra of the peaks. For our case, with extremely high coelution situation, 5 out of the 7 existing compounds under the selected region of interest, were correctly assessed. Finally, the comparison with the classical methods of deconvolution (i.e., MCR and AMDIS) indicates a better performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the number of correctly resolved compounds.

abstract  = "In 1999 a girl named Marianne Vaatstra was found murdered in a rural area in the Netherlands. In 2012 the perpetrator was arrested. Throughout this period as well as thereafter, the Vaatstra case was never far removed from media attention and public debate. How did this murder become such a high-profile case? In this article we employ the concept of the 'fire object' to examine the high-profileness of the Vaatstra case. Law and Singleton's fire metaphor helps to attend to objects as patterns of presences and absences. In the Vaatstra case it is in particular the unknown suspect that figures as a generative absence that brings to presence different versions of the case and allows them to proliferate. In this article we present four different versions of the Vaatstra case that were presented in the media and which shaped the identities of concerned actors. The unruly topology of fire objects, we argue, might well explain the high-profileness of such criminal cases.",

abstract  = "The assumption of equivalence between measurement-model configurations across groups is typically investigated by evaluating overall fit of the same model simultaneously to multiple samples. However, the null hypothesis (H0) of configural invariance is distinct from the H0 of overall model fit. Permutation tests of configural invariance yield nominal Type I error rates even when a model does not fit perfectly (Jorgensen et al., 2017, in press). When the configural model requires modification, lack of evidence against configural invariance implies that researchers should reconsider their model's structure simultaneously across all groups. Application of multivariate modification indices is therefore proposed to help decide which parameter(s) to free simultaneously in all groups, and I present Monte Carlo simulation results comparing their Type I error control to traditional 1-df modification indices. I use the Holzinger and Swineford (1939) data set to illustrate these methods.",

While this phenotype is well documented, the interaction profile of the triple mutant with other microbes is underexplored and incomplete. Here, we thoroughly assessed and quantified the infection phenotypes of two independent powdery mildew-resistant triple mutant lines with a range of microbes. These microorganisms belong to three kingdoms of life, engage in diverse trophic lifestyles, and deploy different infection strategies. We found that interactions with microbes that do not directly enter leaf epidermal cells were seemingly unaltered or showed even enhanced microbial growth or symptom formation in the mlo2 mlo6 mlo12 triple mutants, as shown for Pseudomonas syringae and Fusarium oxysporum. By contrast, the mlo2 mlo6 mlo12 triple mutants exhibited reduced host cell entry rates by Colletotrichum higginsianum, a fungal pathogen showing direct penetration of leaf epidermal cells comparable to G. orontii. Together with previous findings, the results of this study strengthen the notion that mutations in genes MLO2, MLO6 and MLO12 not only restrict powdery mildew colonization, but also affect interactions with a number of other phytopathogens.",

abstract  = "The genome of Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) consists of a set of eleven 'core' chromosomes, shared by most strains and responsible for housekeeping, and one or several accessory chromosomes. We sequenced a strain of Fo f.sp. radicis-cucumerinum (Forc) using PacBio SMRT sequencing. All but one of the core chromosomes were assembled into single contigs, and a chromosome that shows all the hallmarks of a pathogenicity chromosome comprised two contigs. A central part of this chromosome contains all identified candidate effector genes, including homologs of SIX6, SIX9, SIX11 and SIX 13. We show that SIX6 contributes to virulence of Forc. Through horizontal chromosome transfer (HCT) to a non-pathogenic strain, we also show that the accessory chromosome containing the SIX gene homologs is indeed a pathogenicity chromosome for cucurbit infection. Conversely, complete loss of virulence was observed in Forc016 strains that lost this chromosome. We conclude that also a non-wilt-inducing Fo pathogen relies on effector proteins for successful infection and that the Forc pathogenicity chromosome contains all the information necessary for causing root rot of cucurbits. Three out of nine HCT strains investigated have undergone large-scale chromosome alterations, reflecting the remarkable plasticity of Fo genomes.",

The major objective of this article is to highlight the influence of commensurateness, or incommensurateness, on both the adsorption and diffusion characteristics. Published experimental data, backed by molecular simulation results, are used to highlight the attendant non-monotonicity in adsorption strengths and diffusivities. We demonstrate the possibility of separating mixtures of n-alkanes, n-alcohols, and hydrocarbon isomers by appropriate and judicious choice of the dimensions, topology, and connectivity of the crystalline host material. Of particular practical interest are entropy-based separations that manifest at pore saturation conditions, relying on differences in the saturation capacities of the constituent species; the exploiting of such entropy effects is discussed with the aid of several examples.",

The resulting next-generation SOSIP.v5 trimers induce strong autologous tier-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in rabbits. In addition, the BG505 SOSIP.v6 trimers induced weak heterologous NAb responses against a subset of tier-2 viruses that were not elicited by the prototype BG505 SOSIP.664.

abstract  = "It is well established that the majority of chlorinated organic substances found in the terrestrial environment are produced naturally. The presence of these compounds in soils is not limited to a single ecosystem. Natural chlorination is also a widespread phenomenon in grasslands and agricultural soils typical for unforested areas. These chlorinated compounds are formed from chlorination of natural organic matter consisting of very complex chemical structures, such as lignin. Chlorination of several lignin model compounds results in the intermediate formation of trichloroacetyl-con-taining compounds, which are also found in soils. These decay, in general, through a haloform-type reaction mechanism to CHCl3. Upon release into the atmosphere, CHCl3 will produce chlorine radicals through photolysis, which will, in turn, lead to natural depletion of ozone. There is evidence that fungal chloroperoxidases able to produce HOCl are involved in the chlorination of natural organic matter. The objective of this review is to clarify the role and source of the various chloroperoxidases involved in the natural formation of CHCl3.",

abstract  = "According to ideomotor theory, goal-directed action involves the active perceptual anticipation of actions and their associated effects. We used multivariate analysis of fMRI data to test if preparation of an action promotes precision in the perceptual representation of the action. In addition, we tested how reward magnitude modulates this effect. Finally, we examined how expectation and uncertainty impact neural precision in the motor cortex. In line with our predictions, preparation of a hand or face action increased the precision of neural activation patterns in the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform face area (FFA), respectively. The size of this effect of anticipation predicted individuals' efficiency at performing the prepared action. In addition, increasing reward magnitude increased the precision of perceptual representations in both EBA and FFA although this effect was limited to the group of participants that learned to associate face actions with high reward. Surprisingly, examination of representations in the hand motor cortex and face motor cortex yielded effects in the opposite direction. Our findings demonstrate that the precision of representations in visual and motor areas provides an important neural signature of the sensorimotor representations involved in goal-directed action.",

IR spectra calculated using density functional theory (DFT) convincingly reproduce the experimental data. Spectral and structural differences are identified among neutral TPA, TPA(center dot+) and protonated TPA and qualitatively related to effects of resonance delocalization. As a consequence of electron delocalization, computed structural parameters for TPA remain virtually unchanged upon removal of an electron. Nonetheless, CC and CN stretching vibrations in the IR spectra of TPA(center dot+) undergo a red shift of up to 52 cm(-1) as compared to those in TPA. Since ionization also strongly influences the relative band intensities, a vibrational projection analysis was used to correlate vibrational modes of TPA with those of TPA(center dot+). The experimental IR spectrum of gas-phase protonated TPA indicates that protonation occurs on the nitrogen atom, despite delocalization of the lone electron pair. Upon protonation, the structure changes from the nearly planar geometry to a near-tetrahedral configuration.",

Using a systematic theoretical comparison along seven dimensions, we discuss the juxtapositions and identify the common ground of the two theories. Building on examples from the alcohol industry, we describe how CPA uses instrumental CSR to advance goals in public policy--we call this politicized CSR.

abstract  = "Stress hormones, such as corticosteroids, modulate the transmission of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity, favouring salient behavioural responses to the environment. The corticosterone-induced synaptic adaptations partly rely on changes in NMDAR signalling, although the cellular pathway underlying this effect remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate, using single molecule imaging and electrophysiological approaches in hippocampal neurons, that corticosterone specifically controls GluN2B-NMDAR surface dynamics and synaptic content through mineralocorticoid signalling. Strikingly, extracellular corticosterone was sufficient to increase the trapping of GluN2B-NMDAR within synapses. Functionally, corticosterone-induced potentiation of AMPA receptor content in synapses required the changes in NMDAR surface dynamics. These high-resolution imaging data unveiled that, in hippocampal networks, corticosterone is a natural, potent, fast and specific regulator of GluN2B-NMDAR membrane trafficking, tuning NMDAR-dependent synaptic adaptations.",

Our data indicate that nonradiative excited-state deactivation of BODIPY molecular rotors is practically independent of solvent polarity, but strongly governed by viscoelastic/free volume properties of the local environment in both low- and high-viscosity regimes.",

abstract  = "The formation process of massive stars is still poorly understood. Massive young stellar objects (mYSOs) are deeply embedded in their parental clouds; these objects are rare, and thus typically distant, and their reddened spectra usually preclude the determination of their photospheric parameters. M17 is one of the best-studied H ii regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young stellar population. We have obtained optical to near-infrared spectra of previously identified candidate mYSOs and a few OB stars in this region with X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope. The large wavelength coverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the photospheres and circumstellar disks of these candidate mYSOs. We confirm the pre-main-sequence (PMS) nature of six of the stars and characterise the O stars. The PMS stars have radii that are consistent with being contracting towards the main sequence and are surrounded by a remnant accretion disk. The observed infrared excess and the double-peaked emission lines provide an opportunity to measure structured velocity profiles in the disks. We compare the observed properties of this unique sample of young massive stars with evolutionary tracks of massive protostars and propose that these mYSOs near the western edge of the H ii region are on their way to become main-sequence stars (~6-20 Msun) after having undergone high mass accretion rates (--dot{M}_{acc} ~ 10^{-4}-10^{-3} Msun/yr). Their spin distribution upon arrival at the zero age main-sequence is consistent with that observed for young B stars, assuming conservation of angular momentum and homologous contraction.",

One of the major problems with these methods is that the ambiguous nature of relevance labels in learning to rank data is ignored. Ambiguity of relevance labels refers to the phenomenon that multiple documents may be assigned the same relevance label for a given query, so that no preference order should be learned for those documents. In this paper we propose a novel sampling technique for computing a list-wise loss that can take into account this ambiguity. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by training a 3-layer deep neural network. We compare our new loss function to two strong baselines: ListNet and ListMLE. We show that our method generalizes better and significantly outperforms other methods on the validation and test sets.",

This reveals the impact of museum practice and the role of the people who conserve, install or perform the work. The idea is to implement the concept of a behaviour index as an interactive digital tool in museum collection management systems.

abstract  = "Bone's microporosity plays important roles in bone biology and bone mechanical quality. In this study, we explored the accuracy and reproducibility of nondestructive desktop mCT for 3D visualization and subsequent morphometric analysis of mouse cortical bone microporosity including the vascular canal network and osteocyte lacunae. The accuracy of measurements was evaluated in five murine fibula using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining as the reference method. The reproducibility of mCT-derived cortical bone microstructural indices was examined in 10 fibulae of C57Bl/6J male mice at a nominal resolution of 700 nanometer. Three repeated measurements were made on different days. An excellent correlation between mCT and CLSM was observed for both mean lacuna volume (r = 0.98, p = 0.002) and for mean lacuna orientation (r = 0.93, p = 0.02). Whereas the two techniques showed no significant differences for these parameters, the mean lacuna sphericity acquired from mCT was significantly higher than CLSM (p = 0.01). Reproducibility was high, with precision errors (PE) of 1.57-4.69% for lacuna parameters, and of 1.01-9.45% for vascular canal parameters. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed a high reliability of the measurements, ranging from 0.998-1.000 for cortical parameters, 0.973-0.999 for vascular canal parameters and 0.755-0.991 for lacuna parameters. In conclusion, desktop mCT is a valuable tool to quantify the 3D characteristics of bone vascular canals as well as lacunae which can be applied to intact murine bones with high accuracy and reproducibility. Thus, mCT might be an important tool to improve our understanding of the physiological and bio-mechanical significance of these cannular and lacunar structure in cortical bone.",

The current study compared several a priori factor structures, as well as a novel 2-factor structure of posttraumatic psychological distress as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5). In addition, variability in diagnostic rates according to the divergent DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria were explored.METHOD:The setting for this study was a Level 1 trauma center in a U.S. metropolitan city. Data were pooled from 2 studies (N = 309) and participants were administered the CAPS-5 at 1 (n = 139) or 6 months postinjury (n = 170). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to compare several factor models, and prevalence rates based on DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria were compared via z tests and kappa.RESULTS:CFAs of 5 factor structures indicated good fit for all models. A novel 2-factor model based on competing models of PTSD symptoms and modification indices was then tested. The 2-factor model of the CAPS-5 performed as well or better on most indices compared to a 7-factor hybrid. Comparisons of PTSD prevalence rates found no significant differences, but agreement was variable.CONCLUSIONS:These findings indicate that the CAPS-5 can be seen as measuring 2 distinct phenomena: posttraumatic stress disorder and general posttraumatic dysphoria. This is an important contribution to the current debate on which latent factors constitute PTSD and may reduce discordance.",

abstract  = "In 1999 Hurricane Floyd pummeled the eastern portion of North Carolina (NC, U.S.A.), and in its wake many localities participated in federal home acquisition-relocation programs in flood-prone areas, with shared and devolved governance. This article reports on one such program that was conducted in the City of Kinston, where a historical African-American neighborhood called Lincoln City was badly flooded by water containing raw sewage from a compromised wastewater treatment plant upstream. Afterwards, some of the acquired homes were relocated to an adjacent area populated by middle-class, African-American families. The article explores to what extent political devolution of flood mitigation disempowered residents to deal with this crisis in their waterscape. Combining a framework from medical anthropology regarding the logics of choice and care with historical political ecology, it illustrates how devolved government policy led to a continuation of the waterscape's discriminatory history after the buyout program, with no recourse for local citizens as the program worked through a logic of choice that demarcated responsibilities. Understanding this case requires a historically informed assessment of social impact, in which the chosen flood mitigation measures are critically assessed using tools from historically-informed political ecology, leading to a longer-term logic of care where needed.",

title     = "Modulation of GABAA receptors in the treatment of epilepsy",
abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A variety of evidence suggested that an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission could be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of seizures. Understanding the causes of this imbalance may provide essential insight into the basic mechanisms of epilepsy and may uncover novel targets for future drug therapies. Accordingly, GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS and its receptors (e.g., GABAARs) can still be relevant targets of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).METHODS: Up to now, a variety of modulating agents that directly or indirectly act at GABAARs have been proposed for restoring the physiological balance of excitation and inhibition in the epileptogenic brain. While benzodiazepine, barbiturates and allosteric modulators of GABAARs are well-known for their anticonvulsant effect, new compounds as modulators of chloride homeostasis or phytocannabinoids are not completely unraveled and their antiepileptic action is still matter of debate. In addition, several inflammatory mediators as cytokines and chemokines play an important role in the modulation of GABAAR function, even if further research is needed to translate these new findings from the bench to the bedside. Finally yet importantly, a new frontier in epilepsy research is represented by the observation that specific small noncoding RNAs, namely miRNAs, may regulate GABAAR function paving the road to therapeutic approaches based on the modulation of gene expression.CONCLUSION: Here, we review key physiological, neuropathological and functional studies that altogether strengthen the role of modulation of GABAARs function as therapeutic target. The discovery of the novel molecular mechanisms underlying the GABAergic transmission in epilepsy represents another heavy piece in the 'epileptic puzzle'. Even if GABAAR is an old story in the pharmacology of the epilepsy, the reviewed findings suggest that new players in the scenario need to be considered.",

title     = "A general evolutionary framework for the role of intuition and deliberation in cooperation",
abstract  = "In the experimental and theoretical literature on social heuristics, the case has been made for dual-process cooperation. Empirical evidence is thought to be consistent with the idea that people tend to be nice before thinking twice. A recent theoretical paper moreover suggests that this is also the type of dual process one would expect from evolution. In 'Intuition, deliberation, and the evolution of cooperation' by Bear and Rand, natural selection never favours agents who use deliberation to override the impulse to defect, while deliberation can be favoured if it serves to undermine cooperation in interactions without future repercussions. Here we show that this conclusion depends on a seemingly innocuous assumption about the distribution of the costs of deliberation, and that with different distributions, dual-process defectors can also evolve. Dual-process defectors intuitively defect, but use deliberation to switch to cooperation when it is in their self-interest to do so (that is, when future repercussions exist). The more general model also shows that there is a variety of strategies that combine intuition and deliberation with Bayesian learning and strategic ignorance. Our results thereby unify and generalize findings from different, seemingly unrelated parts of the literature.",

The sequence of degree bounds acts as the only input parameter of the model. This parameter entirely defines the timing of the phase transition. Moreover, the size distribution of connected components features a rich temporal dynamics that includes: switching between exponential and algebraic asymptotes and acquiring oscillations. The results regarding the phase transition and the expected size of a connected component are obtained in a closed form. An exact expression for the size distribution is resolved up to the convolution power and is computable in subquadratic time. The theoretical results are illustrated on a few special cases, including a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations.",

abstract  = "Cyclic peptides (CPs) that self-assemble in nanotubes can be candidates for use as antifreeze proteins. Based on the cyclic peptide sequence cyclo-[(L-LYS-D-ALA-L-LEU-D-ALA)(2)], which can stack into nanotubes, we propose a putative antifreeze cyclic peptide (AFCP) sequence, cyclo-[(L-LYS-D-ALA)(2)-(L-THR-D-ALA)(2)], containing THR-ALA-THR ice binding motifs. Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the stability of these cyclic peptides and their growth mechanism. Both nanotube sequences get more stable as a function of size. The relative stability of the AFCP sequence CPNT increases at sizes greater than a dimer by forming intermolecular THR side chain H-bonds. We find that, like the naturally occurring AF protein from spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), the THR distances of the AFCP's ice binding motif match the ice prism plane O-O distances, thus making the AFCP a suitable AF candidate. In addition, we investigated the nanotube growth process, i.e. the association/dissociation of a single CP to an existing AFCP nanotube, by Transition Path Sampling. We found a general dock-lock mechanism, in which a single CP first docks loosely before locking into place. Moreover, we identified several qualitatively different mechanisms for association, involving different metastable intermediates, including a state in which the peptide was misfolded inside the hydrophobic core of the tube. Finally, we find evidence for a mechanism involving non-specific association followed by 1D diffusion. Under most conditions, this will be the dominant pathway. The results yield insights into the mechanisms of peptide assembly, and might lead to an improved design of self-assembling antifreeze proteins.",

This analytical work of companies forms part of a chain, whereby transactions data are analysed, collected, reported, shared, and eventually deployed as a basis for intervention by police and prosecution. This article develops the notion of the Chain of Security in order to conceptualise the ways in which security judgements are made across public/private domains and on the basis of commercial transactions. Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour, this article understands the security chain as the set of practices whereby commercial transactions are collected, stored, transferred, and analysed, in order to arrive at security facts. Understanding the trajectory of the suspicious transaction as a series of translations across professional domains draws attention to the processes of sequencing, movement, and referral in the production of security judgements. The article uses the chain of financial suspicious transactions reporting as example to show how this research 'thinking tool' can work. In doing so, it aims to contribute to debates at the intersection between International Relations (IR) and Science-and-Technology Studies (STS).",

Collecting large scale training samples with relevance labels involves human labor which is timeconsuming and expensive. Selective sampling and active learning techniques have been developed and proven effective in addressing this problem. However, most active methods do not scale well and need to rebuild the model a.er selected samples are added to the previous training set. We propose a sampling method which selects a set of instances and labels the full set only once before training the ranking model. Our method is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering (average linkage) and we also report the performance of other linkage criteria that measure the distance between two clusters of query-document pairs. Another di.erence from previous hierarchical clustering is that we cluster the instances belonging to the same query, which usually outperforms the baselines.",

However, classical methods for inferring topic models do not scale up to the massive size of today's publicly available Web-scale data sets. The state-of-the-art approaches rely on custom strategies, implementations and hardware to facilitate their asynchronous, communication-intensive workloads. We present APS-LDA, which integrates state-of-the-art topic modeling with cluster computing frameworks such as Spark using a novel asynchronous parameter server. Advantages of this integration include convenient usage of existing data processing pipelines and eliminating the need for disk writes as data can be kept in memory from start to finish. Our goal is not to outperform highly customized implementations, but to propose a general high-performance topic modeling framework that can easily be used in today's data processing pipelines. We compare APS-LDA to the existing Spark LDA implementations and show that our system can, on a 480-core cluster, process up to 135x more data and 10x more topics without sacricing model quality.",

We discuss data from a Give X task (Wynn 1992) administered to 77 Dutch monolinguals (2;11-6;04), that support a so-called knower-level acquisition pattern (e.g. Le Corre & Carey 2007) for Dutch cardinals, but show a more complex picture for ordinals, which are acquired around the time a child masters the necessary counting principles and becomes a CP (cardinal principle) knower. Not only is the tiered pattern absent in regular low ordinals, we also see it takes time for children to link drie 'three' to irregular derde 'third'. We take this as evidence that ordinals are acquired via rules, rather than being stored lexically one by one.",

abstract  = "E-2-hexenal is a volatile compound that is commonly emitted by wounded or stressed plants. It belongs to the group of so-called green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which play an important role in transferring information to plants and insects. While most biosynthetic enzymes upstream of E-2-hexenal have been studied extensively, much less is known about the enzyme responsible for the conversion from Z-3- to E-2-hexenal. In this study we have identified two (3Z):(2E)-hexenal isomerases (HIs) from cucumber fruits by classical biochemical fractionation techniques and we were able to confirm their activity by heterologous expression. Recombinant protein of the HIs did not only convert the leaf aldehyde Z-3-hexenal to E-2-hexenal, but also (Z, Z)-3,6-nonadienal to (E, Z)2,6-nonadienal, these last two representing major flavor volatiles of cucumber fruits. Transient expression of the cucumber HIs in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves drastically changed the GLV bouquet of damaged plants from a Z-3- to an E-2-enriched GLV profile. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that the two HIs showed distinct expression patterns. While HI-1 was specifically expressed in the flesh of cucumber fruits HI-2 was expressed in leaves as well. Interestingly, wounding of cucumber leaves caused only a slight increase in HI-2 transcript levels. These results demonstrate that cucumber HIs are responsible for the rearrangement of Z-3-aldehydes in both leaves and fruits. Future research will reveal the physiological importance of an increased conversion to E-2-aldehydes for plants and insects.",

Predicting such interactions from large expression datasets by performing targeted knock-down/knock-out approaches is a challenging task. We use the currently available expression datasets (in situ hybridization images & qPCR time series) for a basal anthozoan the sea anemone N. vectensis to construct continuous spatiotemporal gene expression patterns during its early development. Moreover, by combining cluster results from each dataset we develop a method that provides testable hypotheses about potential genetic interactions. We show that the analysis of spatial gene expression patterns reveals functional regions of the embryo during the gastrulation. The clustering results from qPCR time series unveils significant temporal events and highlights genes potentially involved in N. vectensis gastrulation. Furthermore, we introduce a method for merging the clustering results from spatial and temporal datasets by which we can group genes that are expressed in the same region and at the time. We demonstrate that the merged clusters can be used to identify GRN interactions involved in various processes and to predict possible activators or repressors of any gene in the dataset. Finally, we validate our methods and results by predicting the repressor effect of NvErg on NvBra in the central domain during the gastrulation that has recently been confirmed by functional analysis.",

abstract  = "We report on the discovery of a new fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 150215, with the Parkes radio telescope on 2015 February 15. The burst was detected in real time with a dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6 +- 0.8 pc cm-3, a pulse duration of 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5} ms, and a measured peak flux density assuming that the burst was at beam centre of 0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} Jy. The FRB originated at a Galactic longitude and latitude of 24.66deg, 5.28deg and 25deg away from the Galactic Center. The burst was found to be 43 +- 5 per cent linearly polarized with a rotation measure (RM) in the range -9 --RM --12 rad m-2 (95 per cent confidence level), consistent with zero. The burst was followed up with 11 telescopes to search for radio, optical, X-ray, g-ray and neutrino emission. Neither transient nor variable emission was found to be associated with the burst and no repeat pulses have been observed in 17.25 h of observing. The sightline to the burst is close to the Galactic plane and the observed physical properties of FRB 150215 demonstrate the existence of sight lines of anomalously low RM for a given electron column density. The Galactic RM foreground may approach a null value due to magnetic field reversals along the line of sight, a decreased total electron column density from the Milky Way, or some combination of these effects. A lower Galactic DM contribution might explain why this burst was detectable whereas previous searches at low latitude have had lower detection rates than those out of the plane.",

abstract  = "We investigate the transient and stationary queue length distributions of a class of service systems with correlated service times. The classical MX/ G/ 1 queue with semi-Markov service times is the most prominent example in this class and serves as a vehicle to display our results. The sequence of service times is governed by a modulating process J(t). The state of J(*) at a service initiation time determines the joint distribution of the subsequent service duration and the state of J(*) at the next service initiation. Several earlier works have imposed technical conditions, on the zeros of a matrix determinant arising in the analysis, that are required in the computation of the stationary queue length probabilities. The imposed conditions in several of these articles are difficult or impossible to verify. Without such assumptions, we determine both the transient and the steady-state joint distribution of the number of customers immediately after a departure and the state of the process J(t) at the start of the next service. We numerically investigate how the mean queue length is affected by variability in the number of customers that arrive during a single service time. Our main observations here are that increasing variability may reduce the mean queue length, and that the Markovian dependence of service times can lead to large queue lengths, even if the system is not in heavy traffic.",

abstract  = "Introduction Current computational tools for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics profiling do not focus on metabolite identification, that still remains as the entire workflow bottleneck and it relies on manual data reviewing. Metabolomics advent has fostered the development of public metabolite repositories containing mass spectra and retention indices, two orthogonal properties needed for metabolite identification. Such libraries can be used for library-driven compound profiling of large datasets produced in metabolomics, a complementary approach to current GC-MS non-targeted data analysis solutions that can eventually help to assess metabolite identities more efficiently. Results This paper introduces Baitmet, an integrated open-source computational tool written in R enclosing a complete workflow to perform high-throughput library-driven GC-MS profiling in complex samples. Baitmet capabilities were assayed in a metabolomics study involving 182 human serum samples where a set of 61 metabolites were profiled given a reference library. Conclusions Baitmet allows high-throughput and wide scope interrogation on the metabolic composition of complex samples analyzed using GC-MS via freely available spectral data.

title       = "Basic income in the European Union: a conundrum rather than a solution",
abstract    = "In Basic Income. A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy, Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght table two arguments that focus explicitly on the European Union. Their first argument concerns strategies to introduce basic income at the national level: VP&V argue that there is a tension between national basic income and the European principle of free movement; to cope with the threat of selective immigration, the sustainability of national basic income imposes 'firm limits on hospitality'. The second argument concerns the introduction of a pan-European basic income: VP&V contend that pan-European basic income is the best answer to social challenges created by European integration. In this paper, I develop three claims. My first claim is that VP&V are unclear about the consequences of 'firm limits on hospitality' for the European principle of free movement: this renders their case ambiguous with regard to a core feature of the EU. National basic income seems incompatible with a consistent and legitimate logic of free movement and non-discrimination; to support this claim, I sketch a normative framework with regard to free movement and non-discrimination. My second claim concerns VP&V's case for pan-European basic income. If it is true that the EU's principal justice-related problem is that European integration has diminished core capabilities of national welfare states, such as national redistribution and national stabilization, without adequately ensuring their functioning at a higher level, the remedies to that problem are essentially different from a pan-European basic income. My third claim concerns both national basic income and pan-European basic income. The starting point of VP&V's case for basic income is compelling: we all benefit from a common inheritance, for which none of us did anything. However, more arguments are needed why basic income should be the priority amidst competing claims on the 'gift' constituted by past technological, economic and social progress. In fact, the need to add a social dimension to the European project militates against rather than in favour of basic income, be it national or pan-European",

We analyzed bone and osteoclast structure in adseverin conditional null mice at alveolar and long bone sites. In wild-type and adseverin null mice, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, there were no differences of bone mineral content or bone mineral density, indicating no change of bone metabolism. In tibiae, TRAcP+ osteoclasts were formed in comparable numbers in adseverin null and wild-type mice. Ultrastructural analysis showed normal and similar abundance of ruffled borders, sealing zones, and mitochondria, and with no difference of osteoclast nuclear numbers. In contrast, analyses of long bone showed that in the absence of adseverin osteoclasts were smaller (120 +- 13 vs. 274 +- 19 um2; p -- 0.05), as were nuclear size and the surface area of cytoplasm. The nuclei of adseverin null osteoclasts exhibited more heterochromatin (31 +- 3%) than wild-type cells (8 +- 1%), suggesting that adseverin affects cell differentiation. The data indicate that in healthy, developing tissues, adseverin contributes to the regulation of osteoclast structure but not to bone metabolism in vivo.",

abstract  = "Constructing functional forms and their corresponding force field parameters for the metal linker interface of metal-organic frameworks is challenging. We propose fitting these parameters on the elastic tensor, computed from ab initio density functional theory calculations. The advantage of this top-down approach is that it becomes evident if functional forms are missing when components of the elastic tensor are off. As a proof-of-concept, a new flexible force field for MIL-47(V) is derived. Negative thermal expansion is observed and framework flexibility has a negligible effect on adsorption and transport properties for small guest molecules. We believe that this force field parametrization approach can serve as a useful tool for developing accurate flexible force field models that capture the correct mechanical behavior of the full periodic structure.",

abstract  = "Control of light-induced electron generation is of vital importance for the application of caged phosphors. For Eu-doped Ca11.94-xSrxAl14O33 caged phosphors, the suppressed effect of strontium doping on the light-induced electrons is observed compared to the europium-free Ca11.94-xSrxAl14O33 phosphors. In the presence of europium ions, Sr doping will promote the reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+. The Rietveld refinement suggests that unit cell volumes of the Ca11.94-xSrxAl14O33:Eu-0.06 samples are expanded when Ca2+ ions are replaced by Sr2+ ions. The absorption and FTIR transmittance spectra confirm that the competitive reaction of encaged O2- anions with H-2 is suppressed. For the sample (x=0.48), the higher thermal activation energy (similar to 0.40 eV) for luminescence quenching can be attributed to the more rigid framework structure after Sr doping. For Ca11.94-xSrxAl14O33: Eu-0.06 phosphors, their emission colours are tuned from red to purple upon 254 nm excitation and from pink to blue under electron beam excitation through Sr substitution. The insight gained from this work may have a significant guiding to design new phosphors for LED and FEDs and novel nanocaged mutifunctional materials.",

abstract  = "The gas-phase conformations of the protonated forms of the DNA and RNA cytosine mononucleotides, [pdCyd+H](+) and [pCyd+H](+), are examined by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) action spectroscopy over the IR fingerprint and hydrogen-stretching regions complemented by electronic structure calculations. The low-energy conformations of [pdCyd+H](+) and [pCyd+H](+) and their relative stabilities are computed at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) levels of theory. Comparisons of the measured IRMPD action spectra and B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) linear IR spectra computed for the low-energy conformers allow the conformers present in the experiments to be determined. Similar to that found in previous IRMPD action spectroscopy studies of the protonated forms of the cytosine nucleosides, [dCyd+H](+) and [Cyd+H](+), both N3 and O2 protonated cytosine mononucleotides exhibiting an anti orientation of cytosine are found to coexist in the experimental population. The 2'-hydroxyl substituent does not significantly influence the most stable conformations of [pCyd+H](+) versus those of [pdCyd+H](+), as the IRMPD spectral profiles of [pdCyd+H](+) and [pCyd+H](+) are similar. However, the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl substituent does influence the relative intensities of the measured IRMPD bands. Comparisons to IRMPD spectroscopy studies of the deprotonated forms of the cytosine mononucleotides, [pdCyd-H](-) and [pCyd-H](-), provide insight into the effects of protonation versus deprotonation on the conformational features of the nucleobase and sugar moieties. Likewise, comparisons to results of IRMPD spectroscopy studies of the protonated cytosine nucleosides provide insight into the influence of the phosphate moiety on structure. Comparison with previous ion mobility results shows the superiority of IRMPD spectroscopy for distinguishing various protonation sites.",

Exponential decay of the shot noise is assumed, so that the queueing systems are amenable to analysis. In particular, we perform transient analysis on the number of jobs in the queue jointly with the value of the driving shot-noise process. Additionally, we derive heavy-traffic asymptotics for the number of jobs in the system by using a linear scaling of the shot intensity.

Materials and methods: Periodontal maintenance patients volunteered to be enrolled into this randomized controlled examiner-blind parallel study. At baseline and after 3 months, plaque scores, bleeding upon pocket probing scores and probing pocket depth (PPD) were assessed. The type of IDB (conical or cylindrical) was randomly assigned to each patient and individual instruction was provided regarding the method of use and the appropriate size. Only those approximal sites that had sufficient space for the IDB were eligible, and for those sites the data were analysed separately. Analyses were performed for all eligible approximal surfaces and a sub-analysis was performed for vestibular and lingual surfaces. Results: In total, 51 participants attended the baseline and the 3-month clinical appointments. Overall, there was no difference between conical and cylindrical IDBs. However, the conical IDB showed significantly higher plaque and bleeding scores at the lingual approximal sites. The cause of this difference was an increase in plaque and bleeding scores compared with baseline. With respect to the PPD, no difference between the IDBs was observed. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this experiment, the conical IDBs are less effective than cylindrical IDBs with respect to lingual approximal plaque removal. Thus, in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy, the cylindrical shape should be the first choice of IDB to obtain and maintain gingival health around natural teeth.",

abstract  = "This paper investigates practices of cultural exchange using seventeenth-century Venetian Crete and its capital city Candia (modern Heraklion) as a case study. It explores the material goods of the dowries assigned to brides during the period 1600-1645, focusing on the Venetian female garment vestura. The paper selectively draws on unpublished archival material collected in the notary archives of Candia of the State Archives of Venice. Marriage agreements and inventories of movable property demonstrate a certain consumption behaviour during marriage that enables the movement of material goods to various directions: upwards, downwards, through different time periods, geographical entities and socioeconomic strata.A major parameter that the paper probes into is the question of what was the role of the vestura in the dowry. The Venetian vestura, an exquisite type of gown with skirt and bust, made of luxurious materials and various styles, travelled from the metropolis to Candia. There it became the most valuable material object in the seventeenth-century dowries and it was adopted by the elite and the social stratum of cittadini as a fashionable item suitable for display. By transferring this luxurious garment to their daughters, the middle stratum of cittadini (especially its upper segment of powerful professionals) attempted to emulate the lifestyle of the upper class. Through this kind of conspicuous consumption they presented themselves as nobili, whereas they formally belonged to the non-elite, in the same way as the elite of Candia had appropriated material goods assigned by the elite families in Venice itself. The case of the vestura reveals a bidirectional movement and illustrates that the cultural exchange between the metropolis and the 'colony' was the result of complex horizontal and vertical processes of cultural transfer.",

title     = "A temporal map of coaching",
abstract  = "Economic pressures on companies, technological developments, and less stable career paths pose potential threats to the well-being of employees (e.g., stress, burn-out) and require constant adaptation. In the light of these challenges, it is not surprising that employees often seek the support of a coach. The role of a coach is to foster change by facilitating a coachees' movement through a self-regulatory cycle with the ultimate aim of stimulating sustained well-being and functioning. While meta-analytic research indicates that coaching interventions can be effectively applied to assist employees in dealing with change, the current literature on coaching lacks solid theoretical frameworks that are needed to build a cumulative knowledge-base and to inspire evidence-based practice. In this conceptual analysis, we examine the coaching process through a temporal lens. By doing so, we provide an integrated theoretical framework: a temporal map of coaching. In this framework, we link seminal concepts in psychology to the coaching process, and describe which competencies of coachees are crucial in the different stages of change that coaching aims to bring about. During the preparatory contemplation stage, targeting coachees' awareness by enhancing their mindfulness and environmental receptiveness is important. During the contemplation stage, coachees' willingness and perceived ability to change are central competencies. We propose that coaches should therefore foster intrinsic goal orientation and self-efficacy during this stage. During the planning stage, coaches should focus on goal-setting and implementation intentions. Finally, during the maintenance/termination stage, stimulating coachees' reflection is especially important in order to help them to integrate their learning experiences. The framework delineated in this paper contributes to the understanding of coaching as a tool to assist employees in dealing with the challenges of an increasingly dynamic work-environment and yields concrete suggestions for future theory development and research on coaching.",

abstract  = "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a widely used neuromodulation technique that is currently used or being investigated as therapy for a wide array of human diseases such as epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease, tinnitus, inflammatory diseases, pain, heart failure and many others. Here, we report a pronounced decrease in brain and core temperature during VNS in freely moving rats. Two hours of rapid cycle VNS (7s on/18s off) decreased brain temperature by around 3degC, while standard cycle VNS (30 s on/300 s off) was associated with a decrease of around 1degC. Rectal temperature similarly decreased by more than 3degC during rapid cycle VNS. The hypothermic effect triggered by VNS was further associated with a vasodilation response in the tail, which reflects an active heat release mechanism. Despite previous evidence indicating an important role of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system in therapeutic effects of VNS, lesioning this system with the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 did not attenuate the hypothermic effect. Since body and brain temperature affect most physiological processes, this finding is of substantial importance for interpretation of several previously published VNS studies and for the future direction of research in the field.",

abstract  = "Relevant achievements have been accomplished in prevention science with regard to disseminating efficacious parenting interventions among underserved populations. However, widespread disparities in availability of parenting services continue to negatively impact diverse populations in high-income countries (e.g., the USA) and low- and middle-income countries. As a result, a scholarly debate on cultural adaptation has evolved over the years. Specifically, some scholars have argued that in diverse cultural contexts, existing evidence-based parenting interventions should be delivered with strict fidelity to ensure effectiveness. Others have emphasized the need for cultural adaptations of interventions when disseminated among diverse populations. In this paper, we propose that discussions on cultural adaptation should be conceptualized as a 'both-and,' rather than an 'either-or' process. To justify this stance, we describe three distinct parenting intervention projects to illustrate how cultural adaptation and efficacy of evidence-based interventions can be achieved using contrasting approaches and frameworks, depending on cultural preferences and available resources of local contexts. Further, we suggest the need to develop guidelines for consistent reporting of cultural adaptation procedures as a critical component of future investigations. This discussion is relevant for the broader public health field and prevention science.",

abstract  = "Varnish layers applied to paintings often discolor as they age, upsetting the originalcolour relationships intended by the artist. The removal of aged varnish layers usingphysical and chemical means is a highly skilled and often time-consuming operation,which is not lightly undertaken. There are many aspects under consideration beforeembarking upon such treatment, including the visual result inferred by spot cleaningtests. In this article, we develop a technique for digital removal of discolored varnishthat can help to envisage how a painting will look following cleaning treatment. Thedigital technique was applied to Vincent van Gogh's painting Field with Irises nearArles (May 1888), in parallel to the painting actually being cleaned, which alloweddirect validation of the method developed. In the new method, we utilized not onlyhyperspectral data from parts of the painting with and without the varnish, but alsoexperts' identification of spots on the painting where unmixed white pigment hasbeen applied. The physical model that we use is based on Kubelka-Munk twoconstanttheory, commonly used to model the optical properties of paint. We showthat with this model it is possible to determine the transmittance and reflectance ofthe varnish layer as function of wavelength. Results from previous studies confirmthe calculated values. With the new method, we created a high-resolution digitalimage of the painting, as it would look after varnish removal, at a moment when theactual varnish was still present on the painting. The new method may help conservatorsand others involved in decisions made regarding issues of varnish removal frompaintings, or may help to visualize the colors of a painting without discolored varnishin cases where its physical removal cannot be safely accomplished and so is not anoption.",

abstract  = "Do economic downturns in the Global North undermine worker safety in the Global South? Literature suggests that bilateral trade linkages lead to the diffusion of 'good' labor standards from importing countries of the Global North to exporting countries of the Global South. The crucial mechanism is the ability and willingness of importing firms to deploy their market leverage and ask for improved labor standards from their overseas suppliers. Yet, cost-cutting pressures emanating from economic downturns might lead the same importing firms to give lower priority to worker safety in their overseas supply chains. When importing firms demand price reductions, overseas suppliers might respond by reducing wages, ignoring safety regulations, and working their labor force for longer hours. The observable implication is that worker safety in the Global South may deteriorate during economic downturns in their export markets located in the Global North. We evaluate our hypothesis using a panel of 83 developing countries for the period during 1980-2009, and find that economic downturns in developed country markets are associated with significant increases in non-fatal occupational injury rates in developing countries. The injury-increasing effect is more pronounced in developing countries with weak workers' rights protection.",

abstract  = "Exposure to early-life stress (ES) has long-lasting consequences for later cognition and hippocampal plasticity, including adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), i.e., the generation of new neurons from stem/progenitor cells in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus. We had previously demonstrated a sex-specific vulnerability to ES exposure; female mice exposed to ES from P2-P9 exhibited only very mild cognitive changes and no reductions in AHN as adult, whereas ES-exposed male mice showed impaired cognition closely associated with reductions in AHN. Given the apparent resilience of AHN to ES in females, we here questioned whether ES has also altered the capacity to respond to positive stimuli for neurogenesis. We therefore investigated whether exercise, known for its strong pro-neurogenic effects, can still stimulate AHN in adult female mice that had been earlier exposed to ES. We confirm a strong pro-neurogenic effect of exercise in the dorsal hippocampus of 8-month-old control female mice, but this positive neurogenic response is less apparent in female ES mice. These data provide novel insights in the lasting consequences of ES on hippocampal plasticity in females and also indicate that ES might lastingly reduce the responsiveness of the hippocampal stem cell pool, to exercise, in female mice.",

abstract  = "AIM: To explore whether specific groups of adolescents (i.e., scoring high on personality risk traits, having a lower education level, or being male) benefit more from the Preventure intervention with regard to curbing their drinking behaviour.DESIGN: A clustered randomized controlled trial, with participants randomly assigned to a 2-session coping skills intervention or a control no-intervention condition.SETTING: Fifteen secondary schools throughout The Netherlands; 7 schools in the intervention and 8 schools in the control condition.PARTICIPANTS: 699 adolescents aged 13-15; 343 allocated to the intervention and 356 to the control condition; with drinking experience and elevated scores in either negative thinking, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity or sensation seeking.MEASUREMENTS: Differential effectiveness of the Preventure program was examined for the personality traits group, education level and gender on past-month binge drinking (main outcome), binge frequency, alcohol use, alcohol frequency and problem drinking, at 12months post-intervention.INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Preventure is a selective school-based alcohol prevention programme targeting personality risk factors. The comparator was a no-intervention control.FINDINGS: Intervention effects were moderated by the personality traits group and by education level. More specifically, significant intervention effects were found on reducing alcohol use within the anxiety sensitivity group (OR=2.14, CI=1.40, 3.29) and reducing binge drinking (OR=1.76, CI=1.38, 2.24) and binge drinking frequency (b=0.24, p=0.04) within the sensation seeking group at 12months post-intervention. Also, lower educated young adolescents reduced binge drinking (OR=1.47, CI=1.14, 1.88), binge drinking frequency (b=0.25, p=0.04), alcohol use (OR=1.32, CI=1.06, 1.65) and alcohol use frequency (b=0.47, p=0.01), but not those in the higher education group. Post hoc latent-growth analyses revealed significant effects on the development of binge drinking (b=-0.19, p=0.02) and binge drinking frequency (b=-0.10, p=0.03) within the SS personality trait.CONCLUSIONS: The alcohol selective prevention program Preventure appears to have effect on the prevalence of binge drinking and alcohol use among specific groups in young adolescents in the Netherlands, particularly the SS personality trait and lower educated adolescents.",

This study content-analyzed Live Journal blogposts for the occurrence of TPC in three phases of online SSE: initiation, feedback and repost. We compared these to TPC on a second type of emotional expression, emotional venting. Based on Social Information processing theory (SIP, Walther, 1992), and on the Emotional Mimicry in Context (EMC, Hess & Fischer, 2013) framework, we study predictive relationships in TPC usage in our phased model of online SSE. Results showed that TPC prevailed in SSE blogposts and strongly dominated in emotional venting posts. TPC was more common in affective feedback than cognitive. Moreover, the presence of tactile affective cues (i.e., hugs, kisses) in the initiation post predicted their presence in affective feedback. Results lend support to the idea that TPC are used in socio-contextual ways in online SSE and particularly extrapolate certain FtF nonverbal behaviors, such as the provision of socio-affective touch.",

In our model, planet formationstarts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-sized particles whoseorigin is the outer disk accumulate to trigger streaming instabilities.After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by pebbleaccretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet'sgravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets aretransported by type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall atthe magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. Duringdisk dispersal, the cavity radius expands and the innermost planetsescape resonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also beapplied to other compact systems and that the many close-in super-Earthsystems are a scaled-up version of TRAPPIST-1. We also hypothesize thatfew close-in compact systems harbor giant planets at large distances,since they would have stopped the pebble flux from the outer disk.",

Parents' lifetime symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed with clinical interviews, and infants' negative temperament was measured with standardized observations. Parents with more depressive symptoms and their infants expressed less positive and more neutral affect. Parents' lifetime anxiety symptoms were not significantly related to parents' expressions of affect, while they were linked to longer durations of gaze to parent, and to more positive and negative affect in infants. Parents' lifetime depression or anxiety was not related to synchrony. Infants' temperament did not predict infants' or parents' interactive behavior. The study reveals that more depression symptoms in parents are linked to more neutral affect from parents and from infants during face-to-face interactions, while parents' anxiety symptoms are related to more attention to parent and less neutral affect from infants (but not from parents).",

Humans homogenize landscapes through deforestation, agriculture, and burning and thereby might reduce the capacity of landscapes to provide archives of climate change. Alternatively, land-use change might overwhelm natural buffering and amplify latent climate signals, rendering them detectable. Here we examine a sub-annually resolved sedimentary record from Lake Sauce in the western Amazonian lowlands that spans 6900 years. Finely-laminated sediments were deposited from ca. 5000 years ago until the present, and human activity in the watershed was revealed through the presence of charcoal and maize agriculture. The laminations, analyzed for color content and bandwidth, showed distinctive changes that were coupled to more frequent occurrence of fossil maize pollen. As agricultural activity intensified ca. 2200 cal. BP, the 2- to 8-year periodicity characteristic of El Nino-Southern Oscillation became evident in the record. These agricultural activities appeared to have amplified an existing, but subtle climatic signal that was previously absorbed by natural vegetation. When agricultural activity slowed, or land use around Lake Sauce changed at ca. 800 cal. BP, the signal of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity became erratic.",

title     = "Integrating the teaching role into one's identity: A qualitative study of beginning undergraduate medical teachers",
abstract  = "Beginning medical teachers often see themselves as doctors or researchers rather than as teachers. Using both figured worlds theory and dialogical self theory, this study explores how beginning teachers in the field of undergraduate medical education integrate the teacher role into their identity. A qualitative study was performed, involving 18 beginning medical teachers at a Dutch medical school. The teachers were interviewed twice and kept a logbook over a period of 7 months. The study shows that the integration of the teacher role into the teachers' identity was hampered by the idea that teaching is perceived by others as a low status occupation. Some teachers experienced significant tension because of this, while others showed resilience in resisting the negative associations that were thought to exist regarding teaching. The teachers used five different identity narratives in order to integrate the teacher role into their identity, in which the positions of teacher and doctor or researcher were found to be combined, adopted or rejected in diverse ways. The five identity narratives were: (1) coalition between the I-position of teacher and other I-positions; (2) no integration of the I-position of teacher: holding on to other I-positions; (3) construction of the I-position of teacher and other I-positions as opposites; (4) coalition between the I-position of teacher and a third position of coordinator; and (5) meta-position: trivialising the importance of status. These identity narratives offer starting points for supporting undergraduate teachers during their early professional years.",

abstract  = "We present an overview of high nitrogen deposition effects on coastal dune grasslands in NW-Europe (H2130), especially concerning grass encroachment in calcareous and acidic Grey Dunes. The problem is larger than previously assumed, because critical loads are still too high, and extra N-input from the sea may amount to 10 kg ha-1 yr-1. Grass encroachment clearly leads to loss of characteristic plant species, from approximately 16 in open dune grassland to 2 in tall-grass vegetation. Dune zones differ in grass encroachment, due to the chemical status of the soil. In calcareous and iron-rich dunes (Renodunal district), grass encroachment showed a clear gradient over the dune area. Grass encroachment is low in calcareous foredunes, due to low P-availability, and large grazers were not needed to counteract grass encroachment after 2001. In partly decalcified middle dunes, P-availability and grass encroachment are high due to dissolution of calcium phosphates, and grazing only partially helped to control this. In acidic, iron-rich hinterdunes, grass encroachment gradually increased between 1990 and 2014, possibly because P-availability increased with time due to increased soil organic matter content. In acidic, iron-poor dunes (Wadden district), grass encroachment is a large problem, because chemical P-fixation with Ca or Fe does not occur. Large grazers may however reduce tall-grass cover. High cumulative N-deposition could theoretically lead to increased N-storage and N-mineralization in the soil. Mineralization indeed increased with N-deposition, but in 15N experiments, most ammonium was converted to nitrate, and storage in soil organic matter was low. Soil N-storage is probably reduced by high nitrate leaching, which will favour dune restoration when N-deposition levels decrease.",

We assessed a large sample in kindergarten, grade 1 and 2 on two well-known nonsymbolic and symbolic magnitude comparison measures. We also assessed children's initial IQ and developing Working Memory (WM) capacities. Results demonstrated that symbolic and nonsymbolic comparison had different developmental trajectories; the first underwent larger developmental improvements. Both skills were longitudinal predictors of children's future mathematical achievement above and beyond IQ and WM. Nonsymbolic comparison was moderately predictive only in kindergarten. Symbolic comparison, however, was a robust and consistent predictor of future mathematics across all three years. It was a stronger predictor compared to nonsymbolic, and its predictive power at the early stages was even comparable to that of IQ. Furthermore, the present results raise several methodological implications regarding the role of different types of magnitude comparison measures.",

abstract  = "The current study examined the relations between observed normativity and deviance during adolescents' and young adults' conversations about sex with their friends and their individual perceptions of sexual peer norms. Participants were 16-21-year-old same-sex friendship dyads (31 male and 30 female dyads) who performed a peer interaction task that consisted of five discussion assignments focusing on party planning, sexual double standards, condom use, homosexuality, and consensual sex. Videotaped discussions were coded to capture the amounts of normative talk (e.g., consistent with notions of healthy sexuality) and deviant talk (e.g., consistent with notions of risky sexuality), and the verbal or nonverbal reinforcement thereof. Participants also completed individual questionnaires to assess their perceived sexual descriptive norms, injunctive norms, pressure, and risk norms among their peers. Actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) results revealed that youths' perceived descriptive, injunctive, and risk norms, but not their experienced peer pressure, were related to both their own (actor effects) and their friends' (partner effects) normativity and deviance. Overall, more deviance was related to perceiving friends to be more sexually active, more approving of having sex, and engaging in more risky sex, whereas more normativity was related to these perceptions in the opposite direction. Gender differences in the APIMs indicated that interactive normativity and deviance was related to perceived descriptive, injunctive, and risk norms for boys, but only to perceived injunctive norms for girls. These findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the dyadic nature of youths' sexual communication with friends, their relation to individual sexual peer norm perceptions, and gender differences therein.",

abstract  = "Too much sitting (extended sedentary time) is recognized as a public health concern in Europe and beyond. Time spent sedentary is influenced and conditioned by clusters of individual-level and contextual (upstream) factors. Identifying population subgroups that sit too much could help to develop targeted interventions to reduce sedentary time. We explored the relative importance of socio-demographic correlates of sedentary time in adults across Europe. We used data from 26,617 adults who participated in the 2013 Special Eurobarometer 412 'Sport and physical activity'. Participants from all 28 EU Member States were randomly selected and interviewed face-to-face. Self-reported sedentary time was dichotomized into sitting less or -- 7.5 h/day. A Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm was used to create a tree that hierarchically partitions the data on the basis of the independent variables (i.e., socio-demographic factors) into homogeneous (sub)groups with regard to sedentary time. This allows for the tentative identification of population segments at risk for unhealthy sedentary behaviour. Overall, 18.5% of the respondents reported sitting -- 7.5 h/day. Occupation was the primary discriminator. The subgroup most likely to engage in extensive sitting were higher educated, had white-collar jobs, reported no difficulties with paying bills, and used the internet frequently. Clear socio-demographic profiles were identified for adults across Europe who engage in extended sedentary time. Furthermore, physically active participants were consistently less likely to engage in longer daily sitting times. In general, those with more indicators of higher wealth were more likely to spend more time sitting.",

title     = "Sovereign debt and bank fragility in Spain",
abstract  = "In May 2012 the Spanish government announced a debt-financed recapitalization of the undercapitalized Spanish banking system. Although there was a wide consensus among economists and policymakers that this was key to solving Spain's economic troubles, both bank CDS and sovereign CDS further increased in the days following the announcement while lower bank CDS spreads were expected. Higher sovereign debt discounts deteriorated the fiscal position of the Spanish government. We propose a mechanism that can explain the events in Spain, namely the interaction whereby weak banks that are heavily exposed to risky domestic sovereign debt and weak government finances set off a negative amplification cycle: additional debt issue leads to higher sovereign debt discounts, resulting in capital losses on existing sovereign debt, deteriorating the capital base of banks, additional rounds of interest rate increases, a perverse amplification cycle substantially offsetting the initial recapitalization. We construct a DSGE model with balance-sheet-constrained financial intermediaries that finance private loans to the real economy, as well as sovereign debt subject to sovereign default risk. We calibrate the model to Spanish data, and find that our model is capable of matching the developments in the sovereign bond market in Spain in May/June 2012 quite well. We investigate an alternative policy, direct recapitalization by a foreign entity, such as the ESM, which avoids the negative sovereign risk amplification cycle.",

Although ADHD generally associates with a range of cognitive impairments, evidence suggests that people with ADHD may be more creative than people without the disorder. However, the exact relationship between specific ADHD symptoms and different creative processes is unclear. In three studies, we investigated the relationship between subclinical symptoms of ADHD and flexible versus persistent creative processes. Although effect sizes were small, we found that ADHD symptoms in general were associated with enhanced self-reported creative behavior and more publically recognized creative achievements in daily life, in line with our hypotheses. Moreover, these symptoms were associated with enhanced divergent thinking and with a more original, but less practical, reconstruction of complex problems. Our results indicate that these relationships were mainly driven by hyperactive-impulsive rather than inattention symptoms of ADHD.",

The paradigm is based on the idea that people interact in two ways with their environment: symbolically and physically. The main goal is to show how the paradigm can be applied in the design of interactive systems that offer an acceptable coaching process. As a proof of concept, an e-coaching system is implemented that supports an insomnia therapy on a smartphone. A human coach was replaced by a cooperative virtual coach that is able to interact with a human coachee. In the interface of the system, we distinguish between a set of personalized conversations ('Talk') and specialized modules that form a coherent structure of input and output facilities ('Tools'). Conversations contained a minimum of variation to exclude unpredictable behavior but included the necessary mechanisms for variation to offer personalized consults and support. A variety of system and user tests was conducted to validate the use of the system. After a 6-week therapy, some users spontaneously reported the experience of building a relationship with the e-coach. It is concluded that the addition of a conversational component fills an important gap in the design of current mobile systems.",

title     = "The dual role of media internalization in adolescent sexual behavior",
abstract  = "Sexualizing media content is prevalent in various media types. Sexualizing media messages and portrayals emphasize unattainable body and appearance ideals as the primary components of sexual desirability. The internalization of these ideals is positively related to self-objectification and sexual body consciousness. In turn, self-objectification and sexual body consciousness affect adolescents' sexual behavior, albeit in opposing directions. While objectifying self-perceptions are linked to higher levels of sexual behavior, body consciousness during physical intimacy is linked to lower levels of sexual behavior. Based on this knowledge, the present three-wave panel study of 824 Belgian, predominant heterosexual adolescents (Mage = 15.33; SD = 1.45) proposes a dual-pathway model that investigates two different pathways through which the internalization of media ideals may impact adolescents' sexual behavior. An inhibitory pathway links media internalization to lower levels of sexual behavior through sexual body consciousness, and a supportive pathway links media internalization to higher levels of sexual behavior through self-objectification. Structural equation analyses supported the proposed dual-pathway, showing that the impact of media internalization on adolescents' sexual behavior proceeds through an inhibitory pathway and a supportive pathway. Regarding the supportive pathway, media internalization (W1) positively predicted sexual behavior (W3), through valuing appearance over competence (W2). Regarding the inhibitory pathway, media internalization (W1) positively predicted body surveillance, which, in turn, positively predicted sexual body consciousness (all W2). Sexual body consciousness (W2) is negatively related to sexual behavior (W3). From a sexual developmental perspective, these findings emphasize the importance of guiding adolescents in interpreting and processing sexualizing media messages.",

abstract  = "Silene vulgaris is a metallophyte of calamine, cupriferous and serpentine soils all over Europe. Its metallicolous populations are hypertolerant to zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni), compared with conspecific nonmetallicolous populations. These hypertolerances are metal-specific, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the role of HMA5 copper transporters in Cu-hypertolerance of a S. vulgaris copper mine population. Cu-hypertolerance in Silene is correlated and genetically linked with enhanced expression of two HMA5 paralogs, SvHMA5I and SvHMA5II, each of which increases Cu tolerance when expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Most Spermatophytes, except Brassicaceae, possess homologs of SvHMA5I and SvHMA5II, which originate from an ancient duplication predating the appearance of spermatophytes. SvHMA5II and the A. thaliana homolog AtHMA5 localize in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon Cu exposure move to the plasma membrane, from where they are internalized and degraded in the vacuole. This resembles trafficking of mammalian homologs and is apparently an extremely ancient mechanism. SvHMA5I, instead, neofunctionalized and always resides on the tonoplast, likely sequestering Cu in the vacuole. Adaption of Silene to a Cu-polluted soil is at least in part due to upregulation of two distinct HMA5 transporters, which contribute to Cu hypertolerance by distinct mechanisms.",

abstract  = "Research has shown that organizations tend to use Twitter primarily in a one-way, monologic manner and fall short of using the platform's technological affordances to engage the public in dialogue. At the same time, relatively little research has addressed the specific persuasive outcomes that organizations could accrue by using Twitter to communicate with the public in a more dialogic way. We investigated the persuasive effect of an organization's dialogic retweeting (conceptualized as retweeting of user mentions addressed to the organization) by drawing on the concept of social presence and the theory of reasoned action. In an online experiment conducted with an adult sample of U.S. Twitter users, participants were randomly assigned to view either a fictitious organization's dialogic retweets or the same organization's monologic tweets of identical content. We found that the dialogic retweets, when compared to the monologic tweets from the organization, induced a higher level of social presence, which, in turn, led to a higher level of subjective norms, more favorable attitudes toward the behavior advocated by the organization in the messages, and greater intention to adopt the behavior. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",

abstract  = "Introduction Sedentary behaviour is increasingly recognised as a health risk. While differences in this behaviour might help explain ethnic differences in disease profiles, studies on sedentary behaviour in ethnic minorities are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the levels and the socio-demographic and lifestyle-related correlates of objectively measured sedentary time among five ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods Data were collected as part of the HELIUS study. The sample consisted of adults from a Dutch, Moroccan, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese and Turkish ethnic origin. Data were collected by questionnaire, physical examination, and a combined heart rate and accelerometry monitor (Actiheart). Sedentary time was defined as waking time spent on activities of --1.5 metabolic equivalents. Ethnic differences in the levels of sedentary time were tested using ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses, while ethnic differences in the correlates of sedentary time were tested with interactions between ethnicity and potential correlates using general linear models. Associations between these correlates and sedentary time were explored using linear regression analyses stratified by ethnicity (pre-determined). All analyses were adjusted for gender and age. Results 447 participants were included in the analyses, ranging from 73 to 109 participants per ethnic group. Adjusted levels of sedentary time ranged from 569 minutes/day (9.5 hours/day) for participants with a Moroccan and Turkish origin to 621 minutes/day (10.3 hours/day) in African Surinamese participants. There were no statistically significant differences in the levels or correlates of sedentary time between the ethnic groups. Meeting the physical activity recommendations (150 minutes/week) was consistently inversely associated with sedentary time across all ethnic groups, while age was positively associated with sedentary time in most groups. Conclusions No statistically significant differences in the levels of objectively measured sedentary time or its socio-demographic and lifestyle-related correlates were observed among five ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",

title    = "Freedom in dementia care? On becoming better bound to the nursing home",
abstract = "If closed doors in an institution are deprivation of freedom of movement, do open doors create it, or do they do something different altogether? The challenge for care workers is how to guarantee the safety of residents while not restricting their freedom of movement (too much). Based on fieldwork in one care home with an open door policy, we explore what freedom becomes in routines and practices that allow doors to be open. We show how the possibility to open doors - to, for instance, a dog, or to step outside and come right back in - leaves residents feeling less confronted by mobility restrictions and thus more at home in the nursing home. These 'door interactions' offer residents the possibility to have a position to 'speak' from, even if in non-verbal ways (cf. Pols 2005). We draw upon what Driessen has elsewhere described as 'sociomaterial will-work' (forthcoming), to show how care workers seek to bring about residents' wanting to stay inside, reconfiguring staying inside as something positive. Thinking with Antoine Hennion's notion of 'attachments' (Gomart and Hennion 1999; Hennion 2007) and Bruno Latour's suggestion to think about freedom in terms of being 'well' or 'poorly' attached (1999: 22-23), we contend that the practices that allow the doors to be open bring in a new dimension that contributes to residents' being 'better bound' to the nursing home.",

abstract  = "Colloidal particles suspended in a binary liquid mixture can interact via solvent mediated interactions, known as critical Casimir forces. For anisotropic colloids this interaction becomes directional, which leads to rich phase behavior. While experimental imaging and particle tracking techniques allow determination of isotropic effective potentials via Boltzmann inversion, the modeling of effective interaction in anisotropic systems is non-trivial precisely because of this directionality. Here we extract effective interaction potentials for non-spherical dumbbell particles from observed radial and angular distributions, by employing reference interaction site model (RISM) theory and direct Monte Carlo simulations. For colloidal dumbbell particles dispersed in a binary liquid mixture and interacting via induced critical Casimir forces, we determine the effective site-site potentials for a range of experimental temperatures. Using these potentials to simulate the system for strong Casimir forces, we reproduce the experimentally observed collapse, and provide a qualitative explanation for this behavior.",

While a large range of techniques exist to determine a multitude of properties of these particles, relating physicochemical properties of the particle to the chemical structure of the intrinsic polymers is still challenging. A novel, highly orthogonal separation system based on comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) has been developed. The system combines hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) in the first-dimension to separate the particles based on their size, with ultrahigh-performance size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the second dimension to separate the constituting polymer molecules according to their hydrodynamic radius for each of 80 to 100 separated fractions. A chip-based mixer is incorporated to transform the sample by dissolving the separated nanoparticles from the first-dimension online in tetrahydrofuran. The polymer bands are then focused using stationary-phase-assisted modulation to enhance sensitivity, and the water from the first-dimension eluent is largely eliminated to allow interaction-free SEC. Using the developed system, the combined two-dimensional distribution of the particle-size and the molecular-size of a mixture of various polystyrene (PS) and polyacrylate (PACR) nanoparticles has been obtained within 60 min.",

We assess the extent to which this negative effect of wellbeing on radical voting is moderated by contextual factors. Our study suggests that less well-off citizens vote for radical parties mainly under favorable aggregate-level circumstances. We distinguish two possible mechanisms underlying this effect - relative deprivation and risk aversion - and find support for relative deprivation only among radical right voters and for risk aversion for both types of radical voters, yet with predictable differences between the radical left and right supporter bases. Economic hardship leads to radical right voting when the socioeconomic circumstances are favorable, and to radical left voting when net migration is modest. Our findings suggest a genuine paradox of radicalism: individual economic suffering might foster left and right radicalism, but mainly when that suffering takes place amidst favorable conditions at the aggregate level.",

Furthermore, Smith models, in part, his distinction between natural and violent on Aristotle's use. Smith explains the distinction in his study of the history of physics and astronomy. In those fields there is, at least going back to Aristotle, an idealized view of 'natural' motion or movement versus interfered or violent motion or movement, which has changed over time, particularly from ancient to classical physics and astronomy. Smith used this sense of 'natural' particularly when dealing with movement in The Wealth of Nations: especially the movement of goods, capital and labour. In Smith's system, the natural non-violent movement of humans, or actions generated by humans, will lead to so-called natural prices, natural rates of profit and natural wage rates around which market prices, profit and wage rates will 'gravitate'.",

The concept highlights processes of negotiation to situate, ground and operationalise 'resilience'. The concept puts particular accent on the procedural orientation of resilience - it is not something that 'exists' and that we can uniformly define, rather it is a process that requires engagement with diverse actors and interests, both in specific places and across scales. Negotiation also inevitably entails contestation and an ongoing consideration of diverse options and trade-offs. We suggest that when considering the inherent complexities of resilience, we would do better to explicitly theorise, analyse and speak to these negotiations.",

abstract    = "European CommissionDirectorate-General for Economic and Financial AffairsStructural convergence versus systems competition: limits to the diversity of labour market policies in the European Economic and Monetary UnionFrank VandenbrouckeAbstract and executive summaryDoes a monetary union, for it to be successful, impose limits on the diversity of labour market policies and institutions in its member states? I argue that one should not overstretch functionalist arguments in this matter; the problem at hand is political and the challenge is to identify common standards and policy rules that are functionally relevant (taking on board a combination of arguments on what a well-functioning monetary union requires) and legitimate in view of shared aspirations across the member states. What is 'needed' and what is 'imposed' by monetary unification in Europe, depends on the fundamental aspirations that drive the European project at large. Already in the 1990s, reform in labour markets was justified by the advent of the monetary union. The European Employment Strategy emphasized supply-side flexibility: an agenda for flexible labour markets was interwoven with an agenda of investment in individual labour market opportunities and the development of 'enabling' policies. This essay develops a broader argument: to sustain a well-functioning monetary union that serves the EU's aspirations, we need a consensus on labour market institutions that support symmetry and stability. Therefore, collective action and 'protective' policies are in order. Enabling and protective policies can be mutually reinforcing, in creating resilient social systems. With regard to symmetry, the member states need labour market institutions that can deliver on wage coordination; this limits the diversity of social systems cohabiting in a monetary union, since it excludes totally decentralised and uncoordinated bargaining. Institutions that monitor competitiveness should be embedded in social dialogue, and distributive concerns should be mainstreamed in the monitoring of competitiveness. Mainstreaming distributive concerns into competitiveness makes the 'assignment' for national social partners complex and challenging, but such an encompassing approach may stand a better chance to achieve legitimacy. Simultaneously, EU institutions should avoid interfering in the details of wage bargaining systems. This argument raises an existential question for unions and employers' organizations in Europe: can they commit themselves to the coordination of wage bargaining, with this dual perspective of competitiveness and fair distribution?The concern with stability entails a cluster of policy principles to sustain an effective stabilisation capacity in each member state: sufficiently generous unemployment benefits, notably in the short-term; sufficient coverage rates of unemployment benefit schemes; no labour market segmentation that leaves part of the labour force poorly insured against unemployment; no proliferation of employment relations that are not integrated into systems of social insurance; effective activation of unemployed individuals; and the constitution of budgetary buffers in good times, so that the automatic stabilisers can do their work in bad times. These principles become a fortiori imperative, as quid pro quo, if the Eurozone would be equipped with reinsurance of national unemployment insurance systems; but even without that perspective, they should figure on the Eurozone's agenda. I draw a comparison with the problem of vaccination to make that point.In addition, the monetary union calls for integrated competitive markets for goods and services and cross-border mobility of labour. This in turn entails a social corollary. Next to reform in the regulation of posting, national minimum wage regimes should be transparent, predictable and universal in coverage. This reinforces the case against total decentralisation of collective bargaining. Also, the legacy of the Viking judgment of the European Court of Justice should be clarified. An upshot of the argument is that one should carefully distinguish between (i) the 'social corollary' of the Economic and Monetary Union and (ii) the 'social corollary' of the Single Market; they partly overlap, but are also different. Moreover, the social policy debate is not exhausted by what we may consider as the logical corollaries of monetary unification and market integration. The Reflection Paper on the Social Dimension of Europe of April 2017 is insufficiently clear about this.

The aim of this retrospective population-based cohort study was to assess whether mediolateral episiotomy is associated with a reduction in the rate of OASIS during operative vaginal delivery.METHODS: We used data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) that includes records of almost all births between 2000 and 2010 in The Netherlands. In a cohort of 170,969 primiparous and multiparous women whose delivery was recorded, we estimated the association between mediolateral episiotomy and OASIS following both vacuum and forceps deliveries using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: The incidences of OASIS following vacuum delivery in 130,157 primiparous women were 2.5% and 14% in those with and without a mediolateral episiotomy, respectively (adjusted OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.13-0.15), and in 29,183 multiparous women were 2.0% and 7.5%, respectively (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.21-0.27). The incidences of OASIS following forceps delivery in 9,855 primiparous women were 3.4% and 26.7% in those with and without a mediolateral episiotomy, respectively (adjusted OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.07-0.11), and in 1,774 multiparous women were 2.6% and 14.2%, respectively (adjusted OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08-0.22).CONCLUSIONS: The use of a mediolateral episiotomy during both vacuum delivery and forceps delivery is associated with a fivefold to tenfold reduction in the rate of OASIS in primiparous and multiparous women.",

title     = "Untargeted Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography Coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Rice Metabolome Using Multivariate Curve Resolution",
abstract  = "In this work, a new strategy for the chemometric analysis of two-dimensional liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC X LC-HRMS) data is proposed. This approach consists of a preliminary compression step along the mass spectrometry (MS) spectral dimension based on the selection of the regions of interest (ROI), followed by a further data compression along the chromatographic dimension by wavelet transforms. In a secondary step, the multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method is applied to previously compressed data sets obtained in the simultaneous analysis of multiple LC x LC-HRMS chromatographic runs from multiple samples. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by its application to a large experimental data set obtained in the untargeted LC X LC-HRMS study of the effects of different environmental conditions (watering and harvesting time) on the metabolism of multiple rice samples. An untargeted chromatographic setup coupling two different liquid chromatography (LC) columns [hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)] together with an HRMS detector was developed and applied to analyze the metabolites extracted from rice samples at the different experimental conditions. In the case of the metabolomics study taken as example in this work, a total number of 154 metabolites from 15 different families were properly resolved after the application of MCR-ALS. A total of 139 of these metabolites could be identified by their HRMS spectra. Statistical analysis of their concentration changes showed that both watering and harvest time experimental factors had significant effects on rice metabolism. The biochemical insight of the effects of watering and harvesting experimental factors on the changes in concentration of these detected metabolites in the investigated rice samples is attempted.",

title     = "Assessment of Resampling Methods for Causality Testing: A note on the US Inflation Behavior",
abstract  = "Different resampling methods for the null hypothesis of no Granger causality are assessed in the setting of multivariate time series, taking into account that the driving-response coupling is conditioned on the other observed variables. As appropriate test statistic for this setting, the partial transfer entropy (PTE), an information and model-free measure, is used. Two resampling techniques, time-shifted surrogates and the stationary bootstrap, are combined with three independence settings (giving a total of six resampling methods), all approximating the null hypothesis of no Granger causality. In these three settings, the level of dependence is changed, while the conditioning variables remain intact. The empirical null distribution of the PTE, as the surrogate and bootstrapped time series become more independent, is examined along with the size and power of the respective tests. Additionally, we consider a seventh resampling method by contemporaneously resampling the driving and the response time series using the stationary bootstrap. Although this case does not comply with the no causality hypothesis, one can obtain an accurate sampling distribution for the mean of the test statistic since its value is zero under H0. Results indicate that as the resampling setting gets more independent, the test becomes more conservative. Finally, we conclude with a real application. More specifically, we investigate the causal links among the growth rates for the US CPI, money supply and crude oil. Based on the PTE and the seven resampling methods, we consistently find that changes in crude oil cause inflation conditioning on money supply in the post-1986 period. However this relationship cannot be explained on the basis of traditional cost-push mechanisms.",

With respect to an appropriate topology on the set of all elliptic functions f of fixed order (Formula presented.) we prove: For almost all functions f, the corresponding Newton flows are structurally stable i.e. topologically invariant under small perturbations of the zeros and poles for f [genericity]. They can be described in terms of nondegeneracy-properties of f similar to the rational case [characterization].",

abstract  = "Respondents may use satisficing (i.e., nonoptimal) strategies when responding to self-report questionnaires. These satisficing strategies become more likely with decreasing motivation and/or cognitive ability (Krosnick, 1991). Considering that cognitive deficits are characteristic of depressive and anxiety disorders, depressed and anxious patients may be prone to satisficing. Using data from the Netherland's Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2,945), we studied the relationship between depression and anxiety, cognitive symptoms, and satisficing strategies on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Results showed that respondents with either an anxiety disorder or a comorbid anxiety and depression disorder used satisficing strategies substantially more often than healthy respondents. Cognitive symptom severity partly mediated the effect of anxiety disorder and comorbid anxiety disorder on satisficing. The results suggest that depressed and anxious patients produce relatively low-quality self-report data--partly due to cognitive symptoms. Future research should investigate the degree of satisficing across different mental health care assessment contexts.",

abstract  = "Organizations are increasingly interested in classifying texts or parts thereof into categories, as this enables more effective use of their information. Manual procedures for text classification work well for up to a few hundred documents. However, when the number of documents is larger manual procedures become laborious, time-consuming, and potentially unreliable. Techniques from text mining facilitate the automatic assignment of text strings to categories, making classification expedient, fast, and reliable, which creates potential for its application in organizational research. The purpose of this paper is to familiarize organizational researchers with text mining techniques from machine learning and statistics. We describe the text classification process in several roughly sequential steps, namely training data preparation, preprocessing, transformation, application of classification techniques, and validation, and provide concrete recommendations at each step. In order to help researchers develop their own text classifiers, the R code associated with each step is presented in a tutorial. The tutorial draws from our own work on job vacancy mining. We end the paper by discussing how researchers can validate a text classification model and the associated output.Keywords: Text classification, text mining, random forest, support vector machines, naive Bayes ",

abstract  = "In-sewer transformation of drug biomarkers (excreted parent drugs and metabolites) can be influenced by the presence of biomass in suspended form as well as attached to sewer walls (biofilms). Biofilms are likely the most abundant and biologically active biomass fraction in sewers. In this study, 16 drug biomarkers were selected, including the parent forms and the major human metabolites of mephedrone, methadone, cocaine, heroin, codeine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Transformation and sorption of these substances were assessed in targeted batch experiments using laboratory-scale biofilm reactors operated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A one-dimensional model was developed to simulate diffusive transport, abiotic and biotic transformation, and partitioning of drug biomarkers. Model calibration to experimental results allowed estimating biotransformation rate constants in sewer biofilms, which were compared to those obtained for suspended biomass. Our results suggest that sewer biofilms can enhance the biotransformation kinetics of most selected compounds. Through scenario simulations, we demonstrated that the estimation of biotransformation rate constants in biofilm can be significantly biased if the boundary layer thickness is not accurately estimated. This study complements our previous investigation on the transformation and sorption of drug biomarkers in the presence of only suspended biomass in untreated sewage. A better understanding of the role of sewer biofilms--also relative to the in-sewer suspended solids--and improved prediction of associated fate processes can result in more accurate estimation of daily drug consumption in urban areas in wastewater-based epidemiological assessments.",

Such strategies are often based on theories claiming that cities should attract highly skilled talent to stay or become economically successful. Such theories have meanwhile met with considerable criticism and empirical evidence seems to make the assumptions of these theories doubtful. The most frequently seen argument is that talent moves to places where there are jobs. However, if the focus shifts from attracting to retaining or from 'necessary conditions' to additional preferences, new avenues for policy and research open up. In this article we will first review the debate so far about what attracts and retains knowledge workers. We will then add recent empirical evidence to this debate from a survey of knowledge workers in the city-regions of Amsterdam and Eindhoven. Our survey results make clear that 'knowledge workers' are a highly diverse category in which we should distinguish sub-groups with quite contrasting residential preferences.

We find upper limits of ~1%-2% averaging over the full bandwidth and with a rotation measure (RM) synthesis technique. These low polarization fractions, along with similarly low values for LLAGNs M87 and 3C 84, suggest that LLAGNs have qualitatively different polarization properties than radio-loud sources and Sgr A*. If the sources are intrinsically polarized and then depolarized by Faraday rotation, then we place lowerlimits on the RM of a few times 107 rad m-2 for the full bandwidth case and ~109 rad m-2 for the RM synthesis analysis. These limits are inconsistent with or marginally consistent with expected accretion flow properties. Alternatively, the sources may be depolarized by cold electrons within a few Schwarzschild radii from the black hole, as suggested by numerical models.",

The reliability of recipes as historical sources remains an important issue. This paper examines the relationship between recipes for preparatory layers for oil painting and artistic practice by investigating the authors, their intentions and the recipes themselves. Preparatory layers or grounds are applied to prepare a support (e.g. canvas, panel, copper) for painting. Their influence on the visual characteristics of paintings and their stability with age makes preparatory systems an important topic in art technological studies. Ground recipes were written by artists, amateurs and lexicographers, for artists, amateurs and the general audience. Dutch writers had strong international connections, evidenced by translations, re-workings, references to earlier foreign sources, and by the export of their recipes. Comparison between ground recipes and actual grounds in paintings shows similarities in ground layering and colour, but also demonstrates that recipes may be repeated long after artists have abandoned the ground types described.",

We have developed a system to cross-link cells directly in culture with the special lysine cross-linker bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl-glutarate (BAMG). We used the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis as an exemplar system. Within 5 min extensive intracellular cross-linking was detected, while intracellular cross-linking in a Gram-negative species, Escherichia coli, was still undetectable after 30 min, in agreement with the low permeability in this organism for lipophilic compounds like BAMG. We were able to identify 82 unique interprotein cross-linked peptides with --1% false discovery rate by mass spectrometry and genome-wide database searching. Nearly 60% of the interprotein cross-links occur in assemblies involved in transcription and translation. Several of these interactions are new, and we identified a binding site between the d and b' subunit of RNA polymerase close to the downstream DNA channel, providing a clue into how d might regulate promoter selectivity and promote RNA polymerase recycling. Our methodology opens new avenues to investigate the functional dynamic organization of complex protein assemblies involved in bacterial growth.

title     = "Network Structure Explains the Impact of Attitudes on Voting Decisions",
abstract  = "Attitudes can have a profound impact on socially relevant behaviours, such as voting. However, this effect is not uniform across situations or individuals, and it is at present difficult to predict whether attitudes will predict behaviour in any given circumstance. Using a network model, we demonstrate that (a) more strongly connected attitude networks have a stronger impact on behaviour, and (b) within any given attitude network, the most central attitude elements have the strongest impact. We test these hypotheses using data on voting and attitudes toward presidential candidates in the US presidential elections from 1980 to 2012. These analyses confirm that the predictive value of attitude networks depends almost entirely on their level of connectivity, with more central attitude elements having stronger impact. The impact of attitudes on voting behaviour can thus be reliably determined before elections take place by using network analyses.",

abstract  = "Understanding the structure of proteins at surfaces is key in fields such as biomaterials research, biosensor design, membrane biophysics, and drug design. A particularly important factor is the orientation of proteins when bound to a particular surface. The orientation of the active site of enzymes or protein sensors and the availability of binding pockets within membrane proteins are important design parameters for engineers developing new sensors, surfaces, and drugs. Recently developed methods to probe protein orientation, including immunoessays and mass spectrometry, either lack structural resolution or require harsh experimental conditions. We here report a new method to track the absolute orientation of interfacial proteins using phase-resolved sum frequency generation spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical spectral calculations. As a model system we have determined the orientation of a helical lysine-leucine peptide at the air-water interface. The data show that the absolute orientation of the helix can be reliably determined even for orientations almost parallel to the surface.",

While some linguists (Marantz 1997, 2001; Marvin 2003) consider derivational affixes a type of functional morpheme that realizes a categorial head, others (Lowenstamm 2015; De Belder 2011) argue that derivational affixes are roots. Our proposal, which finds its empirical basis in a study of Dutch derivational affixes, takes a middle position. We argue that there are two types of derivational affixes: some that are roots (i.e. lexical morphemes) and others that are categorial heads (i.e. functional morphemes). Affixes that are roots show 'flexible' categorial behavior, are subject to 'lexical' phonological rules, and may trigger idiosyncratic meanings. Affixes that realize categorial heads, on the other hand, are categorially rigid, do not trigger 'lexical' phonological rules nor allow for idiosyncrasies in their interpretation.",

Genuine VAA effects show up, especially on doubting voters, in addition to the spurious correlation resulting from common antecedent factors. Usually, VAAs will advise parties to users that these users are already likely to vote for, based on antecedent factors. With an abundance of antecedent factors in favour of a party, many voters vote for it even without VAA advice. Genuine VAA effects imply that VAAs make it less easy for political parties to neglect each other's owned issues, because VAAs weigh issues equally for each party.",

The article uses in-depth interviews, textual analysis of committee debates, and roll call voting analysis in order to determine which lines of conflict matter at which stage of decision-making.

abstract  = "We performed an analysis of all Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) and black hole candidate IGR J17091-3624 during the 2011-2013 outburst of the source. By creating light curves, hardness-intensity diagrams and power density spectra of each observation, we have created a set of nine variability 'classes' that phenomenologically describe the range of types of variability seen in this object. We compare our set of variability classes to those established by Belloni et al. to describe the similar behaviour of the LMXB GRS 1915+105, finding that some types of variability seen in IGR J17091-3624 are not represented in data of GRS 1915+105. We also use all available X-ray data of the 2011-2013 outburst of IGR J17091-3624 to analyse its long-term evolution, presenting the first detection of IGR J17091-3624 above 150 keV as well as noting the presence of 're-flares' during the later stages of the outburst. Using our results, we place new constraints on the mass and distance of the object, and find that it accretes at [?]33 per cent of its Eddington limit. As such, we conclude that Eddington-limited accretion can no longer be considered a sufficient or necessary criterion for GRS 1915+105-like variability to occur in LMXBs.",

title     = "Behavior of the Enthalpy of Adsorption in Nanoporous Materials Close to Saturation Conditions",
abstract  = "Many important industrial separation processes based on adsorption operate close to saturation. In this regime, the underlying adsorption processes are mostly driven by entropic forces. At equilibrium, the entropy of adsorption is closely related to the enthalpy of adsorption. Thus, studying the behavior of the enthalpy of adsorption as a function of loading is fundamental to understanding separation processes. Unfortunately, close to saturation, the enthalpy of adsorption is hard to measure experimentally and hard to compute in simulations. In simulations, the enthalpy of adsorption is usually obtained from energy/particle fluctuations in the grand-canonical ensemble, but this methodology is hampered by vanishing insertions/deletions at high loading. To investigate the fundamental behavior of the enthalpy and entropy of adsorption at high loading, we develop a simplistic model of adsorption in a channel and show that at saturation the enthalpy of adsorption diverges to large positive values due to repulsive intermolecular interactions. However, there are many systems that can avoid repulsive intermolecular interactions and hence do not show this drastic increase in enthalpy of adsorption close to saturation. We find that the conventional grand-canonical Monte Carlo method is incapable of determining the enthalpy of adsorption from energy/particle fluctuations at high loading. Here, we show that by using the continuous fractional component Monte Carlo, the enthalpy of adsorption close to saturation conditions can be reliably obtained from the energy/particle fluctuations in the grand-canonical ensemble. The best method to study properties at saturation is the NVT energy (local-) slope methodology.",

These cage molecules were already known to function as a negative tone photoresist for EUV radiation, but in this work, we significantly optimized their performance. Our results show that sensitivity and resolution are only meaningful photoresist parameters if the process conditions are optimized. We focus on contrast curves of the materials using large area EUV exposures and patterning of the cages using EUV interference lithography. It is shown that baking steps, such as postexposure baking, can significantly affect both the sensitivity and contrast in the open-frame experiments as well as the patterning experiments. A layer thickness increase reduced the necessary dose to induce a solubility change but decreased the patterning quality. The patterning experiments were affected by minor changes in processing conditions such as an increased rinsing time. In addition, we show that the anions of the cage can influence the sensitivity and quality of the patterning, probably through their effect on physical properties of the materials. (C) The Authors.

In this article, the logic of immunity is applied to two 2012 Italian war novels set in Afghanistan, namely Melania Mazzucco's Limbo and Paolo Giordano's The Human Body. In these novels, the space of the Forward Operating Base's so-called security bubble represents both the protective and the thanatopolitical sides of immunity, an ambivalent notion that offers the narrative framework to study Esposito's affirmative biopolitics. Both novels are part of the post-9/11 'return to the real,' in that reconstruction and affect prevail over deconstruction and relativism. They thematize the mediatized experience of humanitarian and globalized warfare and raise questions about layered memories of war and national identity. Therefore, these narrations can be analyzed as examples of Vermeulen's narratives of affect, De Boever's narratives of care, and Breu's late-capitalist literature of ma-teriality, studies that question the relationship between literature and biopolitics.",

abstract  = "Infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) action spectroscopy was performed on the b2 + fragment ion from the protonated PPG tripeptide. Comparison of the experimental infrared spectrum with computed spectra for both oxazolone and diketopiperazine structures indicates that the majority of the fragment ion population has an oxazolone structure with the remainder having a diketopiperazine structure. This result is in contrast with a recent study of the IRMPD action spectrum of the PP b2 + fragment ion from PPP, which was found to be nearly 100% diketopiperazine (Martens et al. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2015, 377, 179). The diketopiperazine b2 + ion is thermodynamically more stable than the oxazolone but normally requires a trans/cis peptide bond isomerization in the dissociating peptide. Martens et al. showed through IRMPD action spectroscopy that the PPP precursor ion was in a conformation in which the first peptide bond is already in the cis conformation and thus it was energetically favorable to form the thermodynamically-favored diketopiperazine b2 + ion. In the present case, solution-phase NMR spectroscopy and gas-phase IRMPD action spectroscopy show that the PPGprecursor ion has its first amide bond in a trans configuration suggesting that the third residue is playing an important role in both the structure of the peptide and the associated ring-closure barriers for oxazolone and diketopiperazine formation.",

abstract  = "Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine whether cognitive functioning (i.e., memory and executive functioning) is related to self-reported presence of pain (i.e., affirmative answer to the question whether the individual feels pain) and experience of pain (i.e., intensity and affect) in adults with Down syndrome (DS).Design, Setting, and Subjects: Cross-sectional study of 224 adults with DS (mean age = 38.1 years, mild-severe intellectual disabilities) in the Netherlands.Methods: File-based medical information was evaluated. Self-reported presence and experience of pain were assessed during a test session, both in rest and after movement (affect with the facial affective scale [FAS], intensity with the numeric rating scale [NRS]). Neuropsychological tests for memory and executive functioning were used.Results: Participants with lower memory scores were more likely to report the presence of pain, while controlling for age, gender, physical conditions that may cause pain, language comprehension, and vocabulary ( p  = .030, 58.4% classification rate, N  = 154). No statistically significant associations were found between executive functioning and self-reported presence of pain or between cognitive functioning and self-reported pain experience.Conclusions: Memory seems to be related to the self-reported presence of pain in adults with DS after explicit inquiry, although the clinical use of this model is yet limited. Therefore, further research is needed for insight into the role of cognitive processes in self-report (e.g., involving aspects such as acquiescence and repeated measurements) to evaluate whether neuropsychological examination could contribute to pain assessment in DS.",

title     = "Perioperative management of obstructive sleep apnea in bariatric surgery: a consensus guideline",
abstract  = "Background The frequency of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is increasing worldwide, with over 500,000 cases performed every year. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present in 35%-94% of MBS patients. Nevertheless, consensus regarding the perioperative management of OSA in MBS patients is not established. Objectives To provide consensus based guidelines utilizing current literature and, when in the absence of supporting clinical data, expert opinion by organizing a consensus meeting of experts from relevant specialties. Setting The meeting was held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods A panel of 15 international experts identified 75 questions covering preoperative screening, treatment, postoperative monitoring, anesthetic care and follow-up. Six researchers reviewed the literature systematically. During this meeting, the 'Amsterdam Delphi Method' was utilized including controlled acquisition of feedback, aggregation of responses and iteration. Results Recommendations or statements were provided for 58 questions. In the judgment of the experts, 17 questions provided no additional useful information and it was agreed to exclude them. With the exception of 3 recommendations (64%, 66%, and 66% respectively), consensus (--70%) was reached for 55 statements and recommendations. Several highlights: polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA; continuous positive airway pressure is recommended for all patients with moderate and severe OSA; OSA patients should be continuously monitored with pulse oximetry in the early postoperative period; perioperative usage of sedatives and opioids should be minimized. Conclusion This first international expert meeting provided 58 statements and recommendations for a clinical consensus guideline regarding the perioperative management of OSA patients undergoing MBS.",

title     = "Prediction of individual implant bone levels and the existence of implant 'phenotypes'",
abstract  = "Objectives: To cluster implants placed in patients of a private practice and identify possible implant 'phenotypes' and predictors of individual implant mean bone levels (IIMBL). Materials and methods: Clinical and radiographical variables were collected from 72 implant-treated patients with 237 implants and a mean 7.4 +- 3.5 years of function. We clustered implants using the k-means method guided by multidimensional unfolding. For predicting IIMBL, we used principal component analysis (PCA) as a variable reduction method for an ensemble selection (ES) and a support vector machines models (SVMs). Network analysis investigated variable interactions. Results: We identified a cluster of implants susceptible to peri-implantitis (96% of the implants in the cluster were affected by peri-implantitis) and two overlapping clusters of implants resistant to peri-implantitis. The cluster susceptible to peri-implantitis showed a mean IIMBL of 5.2 mm and included implants placed mainly in the lower front jaw and in mouths having a mean of eight teeth. PCA extracted the parameters such as number of teeth, full-mouth plaque scores, implant surface, periodontitis severity, age and diabetes as significant in explaining the data variability. ES and SVMs showed good results in predicting IIMBL (root-mean-squared error of 0.133 and 0.149, 10-fold cross-validation error of 0.147 and 0.150, respectively). Network analysis revealed limited interdependencies of variables among peri-implantitis-affected and non-affected implants and supported the hypothesis of the existence of distinct implant 'phenotypes.'. Conclusion: Two implant 'phenotypes' were identified, one with susceptibility and another with resistance to peri-implantitis. Prediction of IIMBL could be achieved by using six variables.",

abstract  = "In this work, we present a novel probabilistic peak detection algorithm based on a Bayesian framework for forensic DNA analysis. The proposed method aims at an exhaustive use of raw electropherogram data from a laser-induced fluorescence multi-CE system. As the raw data are informative up to a single data point, the conventional threshold-based approaches discard relevant forensic information early in the data analysis pipeline. Our proposed method assigns a posterior probability reflecting the data point's relevance with respect to peak detection criteria. Peaks of low intensity generated from a truly existing allele can thus constitute evidential value instead of fully discarding them and contemplating a potential allele drop-out. This way of working utilizes the information available within each individual data point and thus avoids making early (binary) decisions on the data analysis that can lead to error propagation. The proposed method was tested and compared to the application of a set threshold as is current practice in forensic STR DNA profiling. The new method was found to yield a significant improvement in the number of alleles identified, regardless of the peak heights and deviation from Gaussian shape.",

We derived, by phase-connected timing analysis of the observed pulses, an updated set of the source ephemeris. We were also able to investigate the spin-up of the X-ray pulsar as a consequence of the accretion torque during the outburst. Relating the spin-up rate and the mass accretion rate as --dot{n }[?] --dot{M}^{b }, we fitted the pulse phase delays obtaining a value of b = 0.96(3). Combining the results from the source spin-up frequency derivative and the flux estimation, we constrained the source distance to be between 3.4 and 4.1 kpc, assuming a disc viscous parameter a to be in the range of 0.1-1. Finally, we investigated the presence of a possible spin-down torque by adding a quadratic component to the pulse phase delay model. The marginal statistical improvement of the updated model does not allow us to firmly confirm the presence of this component.",

This study examined the practice-based perceptions of teachers who do teach with digital games - either playing or creating games - in their classroom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 43 secondary education teachers. Our findings showed that most teachers who actually use games in class perceived student engagement with a game and cognitive learning outcomes as effects of the use of games in formal teaching settings. Fewer teachers mentioned motivational effects of learning with digital games. The implications of these findings for the use of digital games in teachers' educational practice are discussed.",

A surgical plan is made: the affected OZC is virtually osteotomized and aligned with a mirrored model of the unaffected OZC. A patient-specific implant (PSI) is designed for orbital reconstruction. Screw holes from the primary reconstruction are used for fixation. Primary screw hole positions at the repositioned OZC are embedded in the design, to guide OZC repositioning. A second patient-specific design is made for guidance at the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. The workflow was utilized in two patients. The PSI was positioned using navigation feedback. After repositioning of the zygomatic complex, the screw hole positions at the infraorbital rim and zygomaticomaxillary buttress seemed to align perfectly: no screw hole adjustments were necessary. Minor deviations were seen between planned and acquired PSI position; the mean errors between planned and acquired OZC position were 1.5 and 1.2 mm. Orbital reconstruction with a PSI before OZC repositioning ensures true-to-original orbital reconstruction. The use of old screw hole positions enables the PSI to be used as a static guide for OZC repositioning. The combination of static and dynamic guidance increases predictability in secondary OZC reconstruction.",

In this paper we investigate the prospects for SHP in Colombia based on an analysis of economies-of-scale and learning-by-doing effects. We created an inventory of SHP plants realized in Colombia between 1900 and 2013, and focused on grid-connected SHP stations only. In the economies-of-scale part of our analysis we considered all SHP plants with a capacity lower than 20 MW. However, we exclude plants with a capacity lower than 0.1 MW from the learning by-doing analysis, given that their cumulative capacity is still too small for a meaningful learning curve estimation. We used an Ordinary Least Squares analysis for estimating the parameters of our economies of-scale and learning-by-doing models, and observed that infrastructure costs and total costs are mainly driven by economies-of-scale, while equipment costs can also be influenced by learning-by-doing. Our findings suggest that equipment costs for SHP plants with capacities between 0.1 and 20 MW have declined at an average learning rate of 21 We conclude that both the public and private sectors can benefit from scaling effects for hydropower plants.

abstract  = "The enhanced separation power of two-dimensional (2D) chromatography has become accessible thanks to the commercialization of dedicated two-dimensional systems. However, with great separation power comes great system complexity. All two-dimensional systems require a means for collecting and transferring fractions of the first dimension to the second dimension typically via a loop-based interface in on-line methods. It is important to collect a sufficient number of fractions to prevent loss of the first dimension resolution; that is, the sampling rate must be sufficient to prevent undersampling. Another key parameter to consider is selectivity. By coupling two selectivities that have unrelated retention mechanisms we are able to exploit the different physiochemical characteristics of the sample we wish to separate. This is the concept behind the term orthogonality. By. coupling orthogonal selectivities and reducing under-sampling, our system should be able to achieve the theoretical maximum two-dimensional peak capacity. Unfortunately, this is virtually impossible to achieve with current technology. It follows that it is important to be able to calculate the actual (conditional) peak capacity of our two-dimensional chromatographic system. To calculate this, we need to know the first dimension sampling time and the proportion of the separation space occupied by peaks; the latter is referred to as surface coverage. This review discusses the role of orthogonality metrics and surface coverage metrics and their relationship to selectivity and peak capacity in two-dimensional chromatography.",

Two nation-wide samples of vacationers are used: one during a downturn, the other one at the start of the recovery period. Through comparing the results, conclusions can be drawn about symmetric or asymmetric tourist demand across the business cycle.The main summer holiday has an asymmetric profile: being fairly crisis-resistant during a recession and showing considerable growth during an expansion. This does not apply to short vacations and day trips, each having a symmetric profile: during a recession they experience substantial reductions and during expansion comparable growth. So when talking about tourist demand in general, one cannot say that it is symmetric or asymmetric across the business cycle: it depends on the type of vacation.

Although several recent studies have investigated the occurrence of alcohol-related SNS use, it is neither clear (a) what type of alcohol posts are placed on SNS, (b) the motivations to place alcohol posts, nor (c) which young people are most likely to place alcohol posts. This study addressed these three goals. A large cross-sectional study among young participants (12-30 years; N=561) assessed the posting of different types of alcohol posts, the motivations to (not) post these posts, and potential differences in posting between subgroups (i.e., in terms of age, gender, and religion). Participants reported that they most often placed moderate, instead of more extreme, alcohol posts, in particular, when alcohol was present in the post ''by chance''. Furthermore, they indicated to post alcohol-related content mostly for entertainment reasons. Finally, we found differences in self-reported posting and motivations to post according to age, gender, and religion. These findings provide relevant implications for future interventions aiming to decrease alcohol posts, for example, by making participants aware of their posting behavior and by targeting specific at risk groups. Future research should explore the effectiveness of such intervention strategies and should investigate whether alcohol posts lead to an underestimation of alcohol-related risks.",

During the 21st century technological advances have sparked a revival of research into the influence of weather on migrating birds. Using biologging technology, flight behaviour is measured across entire flyways, weather radar networks quantify large-scale migratory fluxes, citizen scientists gather observations of migrant birds and mechanistic models are used to simulate migration in dynamic aerial environments. In this review, we first introduce the most relevant microscale, mesoscale and synoptic scale atmospheric phenomena from the point of view of a migrating bird. We then provide an overview of the individual responses of migrant birds (when, where and how to fly) in relation to these phenomena. We explore the cumulative impact of individual responses to weather during migration, and the consequences thereof for populations and migratory systems. In general, individual birds seem to have a much more flexible response to weather than previously thought, but we also note similarities in migratory behaviour across taxa. We propose various avenues for future research through which we expect to derive more fundamental insights into the influence of weather on the evolution of migratory behaviour and the life-history, population dynamics and species distributions of migrant birds.",

title     = "Cancer is an adaptation that selects in animals against energy dissipation",
abstract  = "As cancer usually follows reproduction, it is generally assumed that cancer does not select. Graham has however argued that juvenile cancer, which precedes reproduction, could during evolution have implemented a 'cancer selection' that resulted in novel traits that suppress this juvenile cancer; an example is protection against UV sunlight-induced cancer, required for the emergence of terrestrial animals from the sea. We modify the cancer selection mechanism to the posited 'cancer adaptation' mechanism, in which juvenile mortality is enhanced through the diminished care received by juveniles from their (grand) parents when these suffer from cancer in old age.Moreover, it is posited that the cancer adaptation selects against germline 'dissipative genes', genes that result in enhanced free energy dissipation. Cancer's progression is interpreted as a cascade at increasing scale of repeated amplification of energy dissipation, a cascade involving heat shock, the Warburg effect, the cytokine IL-6, tumours, and hypermetabolism. Disturbance of any physiological process must enhance energy dissipation if the animal remains functioning normally, what explains multicausality, why 'everything gives you cancer'.The hypothesis thus comprises two newly invoked partial processes--diminished (grand) parental care and dissipation amplification--and results in a 'selection against enhanced energy dissipation' which gives during evolution the benefit of energy conservation. Due to this benefit, cancer would essentially be an adaptation, and not a genetic disease, as assumed in the 'somatic mutation theory'. Cancer by somatic mutations is only a side process.The cancer adaptation hypothesis is substantiated by (1) cancer's extancy, (2) the failure of the somatic mutation theory, (3) cancer's initiation by a high temperature, (4) the interpretation of cancer's progression as a thermal process, and (5) the interpretation of tumours as organs that implement thermogenesis. The hypothesis could in principle be verified by monitoring in a population over several generations (1) the presence of dissipative genes, (2) the incidence of cancer, and (3) the beneficial effect of dissipative gene removal by cancer on starvation/famine survival.",

abstract  = "Several competition authorities consider the exemption of horizontal agreements among firms from antitrust liability if the agreements sufficiently promote public interest objectives such as sustainable consumption and production. We show that when consumers value sustainable products and firms choose investments in sustainability before choosing output or prices, coordination of output choices or prices boosts investments in sustainability and may even enhance consumer surplus when products are sufficiently close substitutes and the marginal cost of investment in sustainability is relatively low. By contrast, coordination of investments in sustainability leads to lower investments and harms consumers.",

title     = "Cannabis use and symptoms of anxiety in adolescence and the moderating effect of the serotonin transporter gene",
abstract  = "There is substantial evidence for the assumption that particularly heavy cannabis usett is associated with a variety of psychopathologic conditions. Little is known about the relationship between cannabis and anxiety. Prior studies have concluded that cannabis use alone is not sufficient for the development of long-term anxiety, and it has been suggested that cannabis is simply a risk factor that operates in conjunction with other risk factors. One such risk factor may be an individuals' genetic vulnerability. The present study examines the relationship between cannabis use and symptoms of anxiety by taking a developmental molecular-genetic perspective with a focus on a polymorphism involved in the regulation of serotonin. Specifically, we concentrated on changes in cannabis use and symptoms of anxiety over time and differences herein for individuals with and without the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR genotype. Data were from 1424 adolescents over a period of 5 years. We used different statistical analyses to test co-development of cannabis use and symptoms of anxiety throughout adolescence and the possible role of the 5-HTTLPR genotype in this process. Results from different analyses showed that cannabis use is associated with an increase in symptoms of anxiety, but only in carriers of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR genotype, not in non-carriers. The findings of the present study show first evidence that the links between cannabis use and symptoms of anxiety are conditional on the individuals' genetic make-up.",

abstract  = "Creative cognition is key to human functioning yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are sparsely addressed and poorly understood. Here we address the possibility that creative cognition is a function of dopaminergic modulation in fronto-striatal brain circuitries. It is proposed that (i) creative cognition benefits from both flexible and persistent processing, (ii) striatal dopamine and the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is associated with flexible processing, while (iii) prefrontal dopamine and the integrity of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway is associated with persistent processing. We examine this possibility in light of studies linking creative ideation, divergent thinking, and creative problem-solving to polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes, indirect markers and manipulations of the dopaminergic system, and clinical populations with dysregulated dopaminergic activity. Combined, studies suggest a functional differentiation between striatal and prefrontal dopamine: moderate (but not low or high) levels of striatal dopamine benefit creative cognition by facilitating flexible processes, and moderate (but not low or high) levels of prefrontal dopamine enable persistence-driven creativity.",

abstract  = "Sensor systems can be deployed in the homes of older adults living alone for functional health assessments. Their information is very useful for health care specialists. The problem lies in developing person independent models while facing a large variability in behavior. We address this problem by, firstly, proposing a new feature extraction method for data from ambient motion sensors. The method uses functional similarities between houses and daily structure to extract meaningful features. Secondly, we propose a change-based approach for analyzing data, taking difference scores of both the sensor features and health metrics. To evaluate our approach, experiments on longitudinal data were conducted, where the relationship between sensor data and health measurements was modeled with linear regression and (non-linear) regression forests. These experiments show that the change-based approach yield better results and that the resulting models can be used as a reliable metric for (functional) health. In addition, feature analysis can help health care specialists understand relevant aspects of behavior. Prediction of health metrics is possible even with simple sensors. With such sensors it is possible to detect problems and health decline in an early stage. This will have great impact on clinical practice.",

abstract  = "The present multimodal MRI study advances our understanding of the corticostriatal circuits underlying goal-directed vs. cue-driven, habitual food seeking. To this end, we employed a computerized Pavlovian-instrumental transfer paradigm. During the test phase, participants were free to perform learned instrumental responses (left and right key presses) for popcorn and Smarties outcomes. Importantly, prior to this test half of the participants had been sated on popcorn and the other half on Smarties - resulting in a reduced desirability of those outcomes. Furthermore, during a proportion of the test trials, food-associated Pavlovian cues were presented in the background. In line with previous studies, we found that participants were able to perform in a goal-directed manner in the absence of Pavlovian cues, meaning that specific satiation selectively reduced responding for that food. However, presentation of Pavlovian cues biased choice toward the associated food reward regardless of satiation. Functional MRI analyses revealed that, in the absence of Pavlovian cues, posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracked outcome value. In contrast, during cued trials, the BOLD signal in the posterior putamen differentiated between responses compatible and incompatible with the cue-associated outcome. Furthermore, we identified a region in ventral amygdala showing relatively strong functional connectivity with posterior putamen during the cued trials. Structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence for the involvement of corticostriatal circuits: diffusion tensor imaging data revealed that connectivity of caudate-seeded white-matter tracts to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex predicted responding for still-valuable outcomes; and gray matter integrity in the premotor cortex predicted individual Pavlovian cueing effects.",

title     = "Evolution of protoplanetary disks from their taxonomy in scattered light: Group I vs. Group II",
abstract  = "Context. High-resolution imaging reveals a large morphological variety of protoplanetary disks. To date, no constraints on their global evolution have been found from this census. An evolutionary classification of disks was proposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I sources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of evolution than Group II. Aims. Disk evolution can be constrained from the comparison of disks with different properties. A first attempt at disk taxonomy is now possible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig Ae/Be stars becoming available.Methods. Near-IR images of six Group II disks in scattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in polarimetric differential imaging, which is the most efficient technique for imaging the light scattered by the disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of this sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the literature.Results. Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in the disk of HD 163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure with a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (--100 AU) disk is detected around HD 142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17 Herbig Ae/Be sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II is due to the presence or absence of a large disk cavity ([?]5 AU). There is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group I to Group II. Conclusions. Group II disks are not evolved versions of the Group I disks. Within the Group II disks, very different geometries exist (both self-shadowed and compact). HD 163296 could be the primordial version of a typical Group I disk. Other Group II disks, like AK Sco and HD 142666, could be smaller counterparts of Group I unable to open cavities as large as those of Group I.",

abstract  = "Purpose: In this study, we examined whether there is a mediating role of executive function (EF) in the relationship between trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress in youth. Methods: Children and adolescents exposed to trauma were recruited at an academic center for child psychiatry in The Netherlands. The total sample consisted of 119 children from 9 to 17 years old (M = 13.65, SD = 2.45). Based on retrospective life event information, the sample was divided into three groups: a single trauma group (n = 41), a complex trauma group (n = 38), and a control group that was not exposed to traumatic events (n = 40). Results: Our findings revealed that youth exposed to complex trauma had more deficits in EF compared to youth in the single trauma and control groups. EF was found to partly mediate posttraumatic stress symptoms for youth exposed to complex trauma, but not for youth exposed to single trauma. Youth exposed to complex trauma showed more deficits in EF, which was in turn associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings provide partial support for the role of EF in mediating posttraumatic stress outcomes for youth exposed to complex trauma. This points to the important role of EF in the etiology and treatment of complexly traumatized youth.",

In the absence of a common security threat, the United States and Europe found common ground in a neoliberal agenda calling for the freer movements of capital, goods, services, and peoples across national boundaries. Today, support for that neoliberal agenda has been rapidly weakening across the West. Drawing on a variety of quantitative measures, we show that Western support for globalization has declined, both at the level of national policy and at the level of party politics. We argue that this erosion of domestic support for globalization is closely linked to the rise of populist parties in Europe and the USA.

Remarkably, one of the catalysts gave -- 99% yield of gamma-valerolactone under mild conditions. This catalyst was also robust, and could be recycled at least four times without any loss in activity or selectivity. The activity is attributed to the presence of small ruthenium particles together with acidic sites on the catalyst.

Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) may reduce such biases and improve emotional functioning. However, as findings have been mixed and the traditional scenario training is experienced as relatively boring, a picture-based type of training might be more engaging and effective.METHODS: The current study investigated short- and long-term effects (up to 6 months) and users' experience of two types of CBM-I procedure in adolescents with heightened symptoms of anxiety or depression (N = 119, aged 12-18 year). Participants were randomized to eight online sessions of text-based scenario training, picture-word imagery training, or neutral control training.RESULTS: No significant group differences were observed on primary or secondary emotional outcomes. A decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improvements in emotional resilience were observed, irrespective of condition. Scenario training marginally reduced negative interpretation bias on a closely matched assessment task, while no such effects were found on a different task, nor for the picture-word or control group. Subjective evaluations of all training paradigms were relatively negative and the imagery component appeared particularly difficult for adolescents with higher symptom levels.CONCLUSIONS: The current results question the preventive efficacy and feasibility of both CBM-I procedures as implemented here in adolescents.",

title     = "Insulin deficiency results in reversible protein kinase A activation and tau phosphorylation",
abstract  = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent multifactorial disease for which Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a risk factor. Abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of tau is a key hallmark of AD. In animal models, DM induces or exacerbates the phosphorylation of tau, suggesting that DM may influence the risk at AD by directly facilitating tau pathology. Previously we reported that tau phosphorylation induced in response to metabolic stress is reversible. Since identification and understanding of early players in tau pathology is pivotal for therapeutic intervention, we here investigated the mechanism underlying tau phosphorylation in the diabetic brain and its potential for reversibility. To model DM we used streptozotocin-treatment to induce insulin deficiency in rats. Insulin depletion leads to increased tau phosphorylation in the brain and we investigated the activation status of known tau kinases and phosphatases in this model. We identified protein kinase A (PKA) as a tau kinase activated by DM in the brain. The potential relevance of this signaling pathway to AD pathogenesis is indicated by the increased level of active PKA in temporal cortex of early stage AD patients. Our data indicate that activation of PKA and tau phosphorylation are associated with insulin deficiency per se, rather than the downstream energy deprivation. In vitro studies confirm that insulin deficiency results in PKA activation and tau phosphorylation. Strikingly, both active PKA and induced tau phosphorylation are reversed upon insulin treatment in the steptozotocin animal model. Our data identify insulin deficiency as a direct trigger that induces the activity of the tau kinase PKA and results in tau phosphorylation. The reversibility upon insulin treatment underscores the potential of insulin as an early disease-modifying intervention in AD and other tauopathies.",

abstract  = "The nucleus reuniens (RE) and entorhinal cortex (EC) provide monosynaptic excitatory inputs to the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells and to interneurons with dendrites in stratum lacunosum moleculare (LM) of hippocampal field CA1. However, whether the RE and EC inputs interact at the cellular level is unknown. In this electrophysiological in vivo study, low-frequency stimulation was used to selectively activate each projection at its origin; field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in CA1. We applied (1) paired pulses to RE or EC, (2) combined paired pulses to RE and EC, and (3) simultaneously paired pulses to RE/EC. The main findings are that: (a) stimulation of either RE- or EC-evoked subthreshold fEPSPs, displaying paired pulse facilitation (PPF), (b) subthreshold fEPSPs evoked by combined stimulation did not display heterosynaptic PPF, and (c) simultaneous stimulation of RE/EC resulted in enhanced subthreshold fEPSPs in proximal LM displaying a nonlinear interaction. CSD analyses of RE/EC-evoked depth profiles revealed a nonlinear enlargement of the 'LM sink-radiatum source' configuration and the appearance of an additional small sink-source pair close to stratum pyramidale, likely reflecting (peri)somatic inhibition. The nonlinear interaction between both inputs indicates that RE and EC axons form synapses, at least partly, onto the same dendritic compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells. We propose that low-frequency activation of the RE-CA1 input facilitates the entorhinal-hippocampal dialogue, and may synchronize the neocortical-hippocampal slow oscillation which is relevant for hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation.",

abstract  = "This paper adds to the literature studying how fiscal variables affect long-term interest rates. Using a sample of sixteen OECD countries over the period 1980-2007, we show that a one-year increase in the maturity of the public debt lowers the long-term interest rate by on average 20-30 basis points. This negative effect is found for both static and panel vector autoregressive specifications. Country sample splits suggest that it is present in particular for low-maturity or high-inflation countries.",

title     = "Modelling the impact of household life cycle on slums in Bangalore",
abstract  = "According to the United Nations Human Settlements Program (UNHSP), the number of slum households in developing countries continues to grow by a higher proportion as compared to its encompassing city. Traditionally, policy makers have concentrated on population control strategies by focussing on birth rates and rural-urban migration to stem the growth and emergence of slums. However, these strategies have often failed to achieve the desired results. In the present paper we find the key underlying processes that explains the observed differences in household life cycle between slum and non-slum households. We find that the slum households when compared to nonslum urban households, exhibit a large variation in the household size over the course of their life cycle, which in turn leads to inefficiency while building slum resettlement colonies. We have developed an agent based model, namely DynaSlum, to identify the key social determinants that impact the behaviour of a slum household. We use a novel and unique dataset based on the field work from 37 slums in Bangalore combined with the NFHS data to calibrate DynaSlum and validate our findings. This paper presents two major insights to address the challenges. First, we find that high rate of home leaving among young adults is the key determinants for the large variation in the life cycle of slum households. Second, we show that reducing home leaving among young adults will reduce the formation number of new slum households and contribute to a higher but stable household size. This will lead to efficiency and higher per capita resource consumption when building capacity for slum development (resettlement colonies) as policy makers would be able to plan for a stable household size.",

Part of those military operations are naval operations off the coast of Yemen that aim to stop the influx of weapons meant for the Houthis. It is viewed that these naval enforcement measures, often termed blockade, have a severe impact on the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen. As the blockade is seen to cause severe humanitarian distress and is leading to starvation, many feel that it has been unlawfully established. The law of blockade is a specific legal regime that regulates how belligerent blockades can be lawfully established and enforced. The question, however, is whether a belligerent blockade has in fact been established in the case of Yemen and whether, considering the circumstances of the Yemeni conflict, the law of blockade applies.",

abstract  = "A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.",

abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: To assess implant survival rates and peri-implant bone loss of 2 titanium-zirconium implants supporting maxillary overdentures at 1 year of loading.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty maxillary edentulous patients (5 women and 15 men) being dissatisfied with their complete dentures were included. In total, 40 diameter-reduced titanium-zirconium implants were placed in the anterior maxilla. Local guided bone regeneration (GBR) was allowed if the treatment did not compromise implant stability. Following 3 to 5 months of healing, implant-supported overdentures were inserted on two ball anchors. Implants and overdentures were assessed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after implant insertion and 2, 4, and 12 months after insertion of overdentures (baseline). Standardized radiographs were taken at implant loading and 1 year. Implant survival rates and bone loss were the primary outcomes.RESULTS: Nineteen patients (1 dropout) with 38 implants were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 1.1 years (range 1.0-1.7 years). One implant failed resulting in an implant survival rate of 97.3%. There was a significant peri-implant bone loss of the implants at 1 year of function (mean, 0.7 mm, SD = 1.1 mm; median: 0.48 mm, IQR = 0.56 mm).CONCLUSIONS: There was a high 1-year implant survival rate for edentulous patients receiving 2 maxillary implants and ball anchors as overdenture support. However, several implants exhibited an increased amount of bone loss of more than 2 mm. Overdentures supported by 2 maxillary implants should thus be used with caution as minimally invasive treatment for specific patients encountering problems with their upper dentures until more long-term data is available.",

abstract  = "BACKGROUND: the worldwide number of dementia cases is increasing, and this is a trend that is expected to continue as a growing proportion of the population ages. However, conducting research with persons suffering from dementia can be fraught due to fears surrounding research risks in vulnerable populations. This can make seeking approval for studies difficult. As research directly involving persons with dementia is key for the development of evidence-based best practice, the development of a coherent ethical strategy to perform such research feasibly and effectively is of paramount importance.OBJECTIVE: this paper aims to review and synthesise ethical challenges in performing research with persons who have dementia.METHODS: in undertaking a systematic review of the current research literature, we will identify the central issues and arguments characterising research that concerns the ethical dimensions of research participation in the dementia population. Data were analysed using both inductive and deductive content analysis. Ethical considerations in research involving persons with dementia primarily concern the representation of the interests of the person with dementia and protection of their vulnerabilities and rights.RESULTS: a total of 2,894 results were returned from initial searches, following deduplication. In total, 2,458 were excluded at title review, and following abstract review 158 papers remained; 29 papers were included for analysis after full paper review and data extraction. Papers ranged between 1995 and 2013.CONCLUSION: this review has highlighted a lack of consensus in current research and guidelines addressing these concerns; a clear stance on ethical governance of studies is important for future research and best evidence-based practice in dementia.",

Using the BRST formalism and working in a simple model with global symmetries, we re-derive a precursor ambiguity appearing in earlier work. Finally, we show within this model that this BRST ambiguity has the right number of parameters to explain the freedom to localize precursors within the boundary of an entanglement wedge order by order in the large N expansion",

abstract  = "Collimated outflows (jets) appear to be a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with the accretion of material onto a compact object. Despite this ubiquity, many fundamental physics aspects of jets are still poorly understood and constrained. These include the mechanism of launching and accelerating jets, the connection between these processes and the nature of the accretion flow, and the role of magnetic fields; the physics responsible for the collimation of jets over tens of thousands to even millions of gravitational radii of the central accreting object; the matter content of jets; the location of the region(s) accelerating particles to TeV (possibly even PeV and EeV) energies (as evidenced by g-ray emission observed from many jet sources) and the physical processes responsible for this particle acceleration; the radiative processes giving rise to the observed multi-wavelength emission; and the topology of magnetic fields and their role in the jet collimation and particle acceleration processes. This chapter reviews the main knowns and unknowns in our current understanding of relativistic jets, in the context of the main model ingredients for Galactic and extragalactic jet sources. It discusses aspects specific to active Galactic nuclei (especially blazars) and microquasars, and then presents a comparative discussion of similarities and differences between them.",

abstract  = "Binaural beats represent the auditory experience of an oscillating sound that occurs when two sounds with neighboring frequencies are presented to one's left and right ear separately. Binaural beats have been shown to impact information processing via their putative role in increasing neural synchronization. Recent studies of feature-repetition effects demonstrated interactions between perceptual features and action-related features: repeating only some, but not all features of a perception-action episode hinders performance. These partial-repetition (or binding) costs point to the existence of temporary episodic bindings (event files) that are automatically retrieved by repeating at least one of their features. Given that neural synchronization in the gamma band has been associated with visual feature bindings, we investigated whether the impact of binaural beats extends to the top-down control of feature bindings. Healthy adults listened to gamma-frequency (40 Hz) binaural beats or to a constant tone of 340 Hz (control condition) for ten minutes before and during a feature-repetition task. While the size of visuomotor binding costs (indicating the binding of visual and action features) was unaffected by the binaural beats, the size of visual feature binding costs (which refer to the binding between the two visual features) was considerably smaller during gamma-frequency binaural beats exposure than during the control condition. Our results suggest that binaural beats enhance selectivity in updating episodic memory traces and further strengthen the hypothesis that neural activity in the gamma band is critically associated with the control of feature binding.",

title    = "The professional middle class in Afghanistan: from pivot of development to political marginality",
abstract = "From the 1950s, the Cold War competition between the United States and the Soviet Union shifted increasingly to what is broadly termed the 'Third World.' As part of this competition, both sides pursued what today might be termed a 'development agenda'- large scale economic aid in the forms of loans, technology, and expertise to help countries escape poverty. Although the purpose of this aid was to showcase the superiority of each side's respective system, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies shared a great deal in terms of how they conceptualized economic growth, the sort of projects they implemented, and even their understanding of the role of the state. In keeping with the themes of this special issue, particularly its focus on the implementation and appropriation of developmental ideologies, metrics and hierarchies, this article explores the various efforts to create an Afghan middle class through three periods: first under the Musahiban dynasty (until 1973) and republic (1973-1978), second during the communist period and Soviet intervention (1978-1992), and lastly since the US-led invasion in 2001. Drawing on archival research (for the Cold War period) and oral histories (especially for the post-2001 period), we seek to place the development programs of each era into broader context, while pointing to the similarities and differences between first and second world approaches. We also compare the Cold War period, when state-led modernization was in vogue, and the current era, when the role of the state is minimized and NGOs are a dominant part of the development landscape.",

abstract  = "Diffusion tensor imaging studies have provided evidence for white matter (WM) alterations in cocaine users. While polysubstance use is a widespread phenomenon among cocaine users, its role in WM alterations in cocaine users is currently unknown. This study examined the relation between the number of substances that are used(cocaine, alcohol and marijuana) and WM alterations in 67 male non-drug users and 67 male regular cocaine users, who were classified into five groups based on the number of used substances. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Using tract-based spatial statistics we demonstrated that there was a negative relation between the number of used substances and fractional anisotropy, a global measure of WM integrity. Also, we demonstrated a positive relation between the number of used substance and radial diffusivity within the prefrontal lobe, suggesting an increase in demyelination with the number of used substances. We did not find a dose-effect between the level of substance use and WM alterations. The results of the current study may reflect the presence of a pre-existing vulnerability to polysubstance use resulting from prefrontal WM abnormalities and related impaired cognitive control although WM alterations because of polysubstance use cannot be fully excluded. This study is an important first step in understanding the problems related to polysubstance use among cocaine users.",

abstract  = "Protest and activism embody a critical communicative dimension. From alternative broadcast and print media to community radio and television, from internet activism to the contemporary protesting on social media, the history and trajectory of social movements worldwide is deeply intertwined with communication and technology. With the transition to the digital, rights like freedom of opinion, freedom of expression and freedom of association have taken on a new meaning. This chapter will adopt the human rights perspective to explore protest activism as it meets communicative action and media technology. The aim of this chapter is twofold. On the one hand, it takes the use of media and technology for protest and activism as a human right, pertaining in particular to the sphere of freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to know. On the other hand, it looks at how social movements put media and technology at the service of human rights and related struggles. Here the use of media for protest and activism is articulated in relation to the manifold ways in which technology shapes the way human rights discourse is presented in the public sphere, focusing in particular the human right struggle is articulated across a variety of platforms.The chapter straddles the disciplines of media studies and political sociology, and builds on our extensive research on community media, internet activism, cloud protesting (or the use of social media for political mobilization), and communication and digital rights. It is illustrated with examples from the author's experience in the field in a variety of countries in Latin America, Africa and Europe.",

abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Practice guidelines for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, mainly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a brief trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for PTSD in adults, but with few well-designed trials involving children and adolescents.METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, randomized trial with three arms (n = 103): EMDR (n = 43), Cognitive Behavior Writing Therapy (CBWT; n = 42), and wait-list (WL; n = 18). WL participants were randomly reallocated to CBWT or EMDR after 6 weeks; follow-ups were conducted at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. Participants were treatment-seeking youth (aged 8-18 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD (or subthreshold PTSD) tied to a single trauma, who received up to six sessions of EMDR or CBWT lasting maximally 45 min each.RESULTS: Both treatments were well-tolerated and relative to WL yielded large, intent-to-treat effect sizes for the primary outcomes at posttreatment: PTSD symptoms (EMDR: d = 1.27; CBWT: d = 1.24). At posttreatment 92.5% of EMDR, and 90.2% of CBWT no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Compared to WL, small to large (range d = 0.39-1.03) intent-to-treat effect sizes were obtained at posttreatment for negative trauma-related appraisals, anxiety, depression, and behavior problems with these gains being maintained at follow-up. Gains were attained with significantly less therapist contact time for EMDR than CBWT (mean = 4.1 sessions/140 min vs. 5.4 sessions/227 min).CONCLUSIONS: EMDR and CBWT are brief, trauma-focused treatments that yielded equally large remission rates for PTSD and reductions in the severity of PTSD and comorbid difficulties in children and adolescents seeking treatment for PTSD tied to a single event. Further trials of both treatments with PTSD tied to multiple traumas are warranted.",

title     = "Pair Copula Constructions for Insurance Experience Rating",
abstract  = "In non-life insurance, insurers use experience rating to adjust premiums to reflect policyholders' previous claim experience. Performing prospective experience rating can be challenging when the claim distribution is complex. For instance, insurance claims are semicontinuous in that a fraction of zeros is often associated with an otherwise positive continuous outcome from a right-skewed and long-tailed distribution. Practitioners use credibility premium that is a special form of the shrinkage estimator in the longitudinal data framework. However, the linear predictor is not informative especially when the outcome follows a mixed distribution. In this article, we introduce a mixed vine pair copula construction framework for modeling semicontinuous longitudinal claims. In the proposed framework, a two-component mixture regression is employed to accommodate the zero inflation and thick tails in the claim distribution. The temporal dependence among repeated observations is modeled using a sequence of bivariate conditional copulas based on a mixed D-vine. We emphasize that the resulting predictive distribution allows insurers to incorporate past experience into future premiums in a nonlinear fashion and the classic linear predictor can be viewed as a nested case. In the application, we examine a unique claims dataset of government property insurance from the state of Wisconsin. Due to the discrepancies between the claim and premium distributions, we employ an ordered Lorenz curve to evaluate the predictive performance. We show that the proposed approach offers substantial opportunities for separating risks and identifying profitable business when compared with alternative experience rating methods.",

title     = "Protecting visual short-term memory during maintenance: Attentional modulation of target and distractor representations",
abstract  = "In the presence of distraction, attentional filtering is a key predictor of efficient information storage in visual short-term memory (VSTM). Yet, the role of attention in distractor filtering, and the extent to which attentional filtering continues to protect information during post-perceptual stages of VSTM, remains largely unknown. In the current study, we investigated the role of spatial attention in distractor filtering during VSTM encoding and maintenance. Participants performed a change detection task with varying distractor load. Attentional deployment to target and distractor locations was tracked continuously by means of Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs). Analyses revealed that attention strongly modulated the amplitude of the second harmonic SSVEP response, with larger amplitudes at target compared to distractor locations. These attentional modulations commenced during encoding, and remained present during maintenance. Furthermore, the amount of attention paid to distractor locations was directly related to behavioral distractor costs: Individuals who paid more attention to target compared to distractor locations during VSTM maintenance generally suffered less from the presence of distractors. Together, these findings support an important role of spatial attention in distractor filtering at multiple stages of VSTM, and highlight the usefulness of SSVEPs in continuously tracking attention to multiple locations during VSTM.",

abstract    = "Abstract Bij een pensioenstelsel met doorsneesystematiek (DSS) betaalt elke deelnemer dezelfde premie en bouwt elke deelnemer hetzelfde op zonder rekening te houden met leeftijd ten tijde van premiebetaling. Bij een actuarieel eerlijke systematiek is dit niet het geval, omdat contributies van jongeren over een langere horizon kunnen renderen dan de contributies van ouderen. Dit onderzoek laat de effecten zien van belangrijke parameters bij overgang naar een actuarieel eerlijk systeem zonder DSS. We analyseren eerst een gestileerd model met drie overlappende generaties om de intuitie te laten zien achter de economische effecten. De grootte van deze effecten laten we vervolgens in een veel gedetailleerder model zien met meerdere overlappende generaties, realistische parameters en rijkere informatie over inkomensverdeling. Uit onze basisschatting blijkt dat het overgangseffect van afschaffing DSS zo'n 37 miljard is, maar dit getal hangt sterk af van parameteraannames. Voor elk cohort zijn de effecten minder dan 5% van hun totale pensioen. We gebruiken het gedetailleerdere model ook om aan te tonen dat er substantiele inkomensoverdracht van arm naar rijk plaats vindt onder DSS. Vergeleken met een DSS variant die neutraal is per inkomensgroep (arm versus rijk) wordt onder de huidige DSS zo'n 10 miljard overgedragen van arm naar rijk.",

abstract  = "Patients with lesions in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been shown to be impaired in lexical selection, especially when interference between semantically related alternatives is increased. To more deeply investigate which computational mechanisms may be impaired following left PFC damage due to stroke, a psychometric modelling approach is employed in which we assess the cognitive parameters of the patients from an evidence accumulation (sequential information sampling) modelling of their response data. We also compare the results to healthy speakers. Analysis of the cognitive parameters indicates an impairment of the PFC patients to appropriately adjust their decision threshold, in order to handle the increased item difficulty that is introduced by semantic interference. Also, the modelling contributes to other topics in psycholinguistic theory, in which specific effects are observed on the cognitive parameters according to item familiarization, and the opposing effects of priming (lower threshold) and semantic interference (lower drift) which are found to depend on repetition. These results are developed for the blocked-cyclic picture naming paradigm, in which pictures are presented within semantically homogeneous (HOM) or heterogeneous (HET) blocks, and are repeated several times per block. Overall, the results are in agreement with a role of the left PFC in adjusting the decision threshold for lexical selection in language production.",

The photographs were treated because of damage to the emulsion. Some emulsions exhibited cracks and delamination of mostly the image edges and others showed sometimes severe delamination of the emulsion in the form of local blistering of the emulsion.Upon careful examination, it became apparent that the photographic support was coated with what seemed to be an early resin coating. Although conservation literature briefly mentions early RC coatings, very little information on this subject could be found. This paper discusses research that was performed to gain a better understanding into these early 'coated photograph papers' and conservation issues affiliated with the treatment of these papers.",

abstract  = "It is known that plant cells can contain multiple distinct vacuoles; however, the abundance of multivacuolar cells and the mechanisms underlying vacuolar differentiation and communication among different types of vacuoles remain unknown. PH1 and PH5 are tonoplast P-ATPases that form a heteromeric pump that hyper-acidifies the central vacuole (CV) of epidermal cells in petunia petals. Here, we show that the sorting of this pump and other vacuolar proteins to the CV involves transit through small vacuoles: vacuolinos. Vacuolino formation is controlled by transcription factors regulating pigment synthesis and transcription of PH1 and PH5. Trafficking of proteins from vacuolinos to the central vacuole is impaired by misexpression of vacuolar SNAREs as well as mutants for the PH1 component of the PH1-PH5 pump. The finding that PH1-PH5 and these SNAREs interact strongly suggests that structural tonoplast proteins can act as tethering factors in the recognition of different vacuolar types.",

Then comes a discussion of social scientific research into violence, in the past and more recently. The interview continues with a reflection on the notion of attention space, a concept which Collins has applied in analyses of violent interactions and the intellectual struggles between philosophers. Finally, the article considers the state of the art of sociology and its future prospects, evaluating its potential for rapid discovery and its position on the abstraction-reflexivity continuum. As the interview demonstrates Collins's insightful sociological craftsmanship, it provides social scientists with a strong and optimistic lead in how to do social theory.",

abstract  = "Strategies for the efficient synthesis of peptide macrocycles have been a long-standing goal. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the peptide ligase termed omniligase-1 as a versatile and broadly applicable enzymatic tool for peptide cyclization. Several head-to-tail (multi) cyclic peptides have been synthesized, including the cyclotide MCoTI-II. Cyclization and oxidative folding of the cyclotide MCoTI-II were efficiently performed in a one-pot reaction on a 1-gram scale. The native cyclotide was isolated and the correct disulfide bonding pattern was confirmed by NMR structure determination. Furthermore, compatibility of chemo-enzymatic peptide synthesis (CEPS) using omniligase-1 with methods such as chemical ligation of peptides onto scaffolds (CLIPS) was successfully demonstrated by synthesizing a kinase-inhibitor derived tricyclic peptide. Our studies indicate that the minimal ring size for omniligase-1 mediated cyclization is 11 amino acids, whereas the cyclization of peptides longer than 12 amino acids proceeds with remarkable efficiency. In addition, several macrocycles containing non-peptidicbackbones (e.g., polyethylene glycol), isopeptide bonds (amino acid sidechain attachment) as well as d-amino acids could be efficiently cyclized.",

title     = "Entrepreneurial or Vulnerable Workers, a challenge for labour law",
abstract  = "In the Netherlands, social security is organised by means of employee insurance schemes for labour-related risks and national insurance schemes for social risks that concern all residents. This system was set up and expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and has endured several crises and societal changes. Nevertheless, it has been able to maintain its basic protective function against the most common risks. The latter is beginning to change, however. Particularly the employee insurance schemes are increasingly failing to protect dependent or 'precarious' workers. This is caused by changes in the labour market. The employment contract, for instance, traditionally the 'stepping stone' to employee insurance schemes, no longer constitutes a fixed, stable relationship between a worker and an employer. Employment contracts have become more flexible, and complex legal structures sometimes make it difficult to establish who the responsible other party with respect to the worker is. The advent of self-employed workers, too, sometimes 'employee-like workers', sometimes 'true entrepreneurs', has presented the government with difficult choices. This is not pre-eminently a Dutch phenomenon. Many EU member states, but the US and Canada, too, have seen workers who are labelled 'self-employed workers without employees' (the Netherlands), 'solo self-employed' (the UK) or 'independent contractors' (the US) enter the labour market. At the same time, solo self-employment (hereafter: SSE) represents a broader development. Even more drastic, and certainly with respect to organising social security more complex, is the rise of Platform Enterprising as an exponent of what is also referred to as 'the third wave of globalisation'. The term Platform Enterprise (hereafter: PE) includes different types but relevant to labour and labour is the transaction type, which stands for 'a technology, product or service that acts as a conduit or intermediary facilitating exchange or transactions between different users, buyers, or suppliers'. PEs originate for the most part from the US, China and a number of other Asian countries, but their impact on labour, labour relations and labour-related social security is worldwide. Hence, the rise of PEs has evoked strong reactions, often positive ones, with governments welcoming PEs as bearers of innovation. For labour law issues, however, PEs are considered disturbing, if not disruptive. The way in which this development is referred to best illustrates the two approaches. Those in favour use terms such as 'creative' or 'sharing' economy; critics speak of the 'gig' economy or even the '1099' economy, spewing out a new 'Precariat'.In this contribution I will restrict myself to the developments around SSE as a case that has more or less taken shape in the Netherlands. I will address the question of what lessons can be learned from the government's approach towards this phenomenon and whether a different or better approach might have been possible. Ultimately, the key question for governments, trade unions and workers is what the significance of a phenomenon like SSE is or may be for the social protection of workers and, in a broader sense, for the viability of employee insurance schemes as a vehicle for this protection.",

abstract  = "A Random Positioning Machine (RPM) is a device used to study the role of gravity on biological systems. This is accomplished through continuous reorientation of the sample such that the net influence of gravity is randomized over time. The aim of this study is to predict fluid flow behavior during such RPM simulated microgravity studies, which may explain differences found between RPM and space flight experiments. An analytical solution is given for a cylinder as a model for an experimental container. Then, a dual-axis rotating frame is used to mimic the motion characteristics of an RPM with sinusoidal rotation frequencies of 0.2 Hz and 0.1 Hz while Particle Image Velocimetry is used to measure the velocity field inside a flask. To reproduce the same experiment numerically, a Direct Numerical Simulation model is used. The analytical model predicts that an increase in the Womersley number leads to higher shear stresses at the cylinder wall and decrease in fluid angular velocity inside the cylinder. The experimental results show that periodic single-axis rotation induces a fluid motion parallel to the wall and that a complex flow is observed for two-axis rotation with a maximum wall shear stress of 8.0 mPa (80 mdyne/cm2). The experimental and numerical results show that oscillatory motion inside an RPM induces flow motion that can, depending on the experimental samples, reduce the quality of the simulated microgravity. Thus, it is crucial to determine the appropriate oscillatory frequency of the axes to design biological experiments.",

Therefore, they are prime targets to search for signals from dark matter annihilation using gamma-ray observations. We analyse about 7 years of PASS8 Fermi data for seven classical dwarf galaxies, including Draco, adopting both the widely used Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile and observationally motivated axisymmetric density profiles. For four of the selected dwarfs (Sextans, Carina, Sculptor and Fornax) axisymmetric mass models suggest a cored density profile rather than the commonly adopted cusped profile. We found that upper limits on the annihilation cross section for some of these dwarfs are significantly higher than the ones achieved using an NFW profile. Therefore, upper limits in the literature obtained using cusped profiles like the NFW might have been overestimated. Our results eventually show that it is extremely important to use observationally motivated density profiles going beyond the usually adopted NFW in order to obtain accurate constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section.",

title     = "Learning to read and write in evolution: from static pseudoenzymes and pseudosignalers to dynamic gear shifters",
abstract  = "We present a systems biology view on pseudoenzymes that acknowledges that genes are not selfish: the genome is. With network function as the selectable unit, there has been an evolutionary bonus for recombination of functions of and within proteins. Many proteins house a functionality by which they 'read' the cell's state, and one by which they 'write' and thereby change that state. Should the writer domain lose its cognate function, a 'pseudoenzyme' or 'pseudosignaler' arises. GlnK involved in Escherichia coli ammonia assimilation may well be a pseudosignaler, associating 'reading' the nitrogen state of the cell to 'writing' the ammonium uptake activity. We identify functional pseudosignalers in the cyclin-dependent kinase complexes regulating cell-cycle progression. For the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, we illustrate how a 'dead' pseudosignaler could produce potentially selectable functionalities. Four billion years ago, bioenergetics may have shuffled 'electron-writers', producing various networks that all served the same function of anaerobic ATP synthesis and carbon assimilation from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, but at different ATP/acetate ratios. This would have enabled organisms to deal with variable challenges of energy need and substrate supply. The same principle might enable 'gear-shifting' in real time, by dynamically generating different pseudo-redox enzymes, reshuffling their coenzymes, and rerouting network fluxes. Non-stationary pH gradients in thermal vents together with similar such shuffling mechanisms may have produced a first selectable proton-motivated pyrophosphate synthase and subsequent ATP synthase. A combination of functionalities into enzymes, signalers, and the pseudo-versions thereof may offer fitness in terms of plasticity, both in real time and in evolution.",

title     = "One-step in situ solid-substrate-based whole blood immunoassay based on FRET between upconversion and gold nanoparticles",
abstract  = "Despite their general clinical applications, current fluorescence-based immunoassays are confronted with serious challenges, e.g. the advance serum/ plasma separation and the tedious washing process in current heterogeneous approaches, and aggregation of particles, low sensitivity and the narrow linear range in homogeneous approaches. In this paper, these urgent problems were solved in a novel one-step in situ immunoassay of whole blood samples by combining the traditional fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology (between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and gold nanoparticles (GNPs)) and the solid-substrate based immunoassay technology. The low detection limits of goat IgG (gIgG) as 0.042 mu g/mL in buffers, 0.51 mu g/mL in 20-fold diluted whole blood samples and a wide linear range from 0.75 mu g/mL to 60 mu g/mL in blood samples were achieved. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first one-step in situ solid-substrate based immunoassay of whole blood samples with large linear detection range. This development provides a promising platform for a rapid and sensitive immunoassay of various bio-molecules directly in whole blood without tedious separation, washing steps and aggregation problems.",

title     = "Water Microsolvation Can Switch the Binding Mode of Ni(II) with Small Peptides",
abstract  = "Ni(II) ions can be caged by surrounding peptide ligands in two basic binding patterns: the ``iminol'' (IM) binding pattern, where chelation occurs by deprotonated amide nitrogens, or the charge-solvated (CS) binding pattern, where chelation occurs by amide carbonyl oxygens. Gas-phase observation may clarify the factors affecting this choice in solution and in peptide and protein matrices. Infrared spectroscopic determination of gas-phase structures shows here how microsolvation by just one water molecule switches the balance of this choice from IM to CS for the Ni(2+)Gly(3) complex, in contrast with the always-CS structure of the Ni(2+)Gly(4) complex. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate that CS complexation is even more favored in the aqueous limit. Considering gas-phase conditions as comparable to low-pH solutions can reconcile this prediction with the common observation of IM-type binding in solutions at higher pH. This is likely the first gas-phase observation of solvation-induced IM-to-CS transition in oligopeptide complexes with doubly charged transition-metal ions.",

abstract = "Large-scale prediction problems are often plagued by correlated predictor variables and missing observations. We consider prediction settings in which logistic regression models are used, and propose a novel approach to make accurate predictions even when predictor variables are highly correlated and only partly observed. Our approach comprises three steps. Firstly, to overcome the collinearity issue, we propose to model the joint distribution of the outcome variable and the predictor variables using the Ising network model. Secondly, to render the application of Ising networks feasible, we use a latent variable representation to apply a low-rank approximation to the network's connectivity matrix. Finally, we propose an approximation to the latent variable distribution that is used in the representation to handle missing observations. We demonstrate our approach with numerical illustrations.",

We herein report the first example of metal organic frameworks of flexible robust nature for the efficient separation of propyne/propylene mixtures. The strong binding affinity and suitable pore confinement for propyne account for its high uptake capacity and selectivity, as evidenced by neutron powder diffraction studies and density functional theory calculations.
