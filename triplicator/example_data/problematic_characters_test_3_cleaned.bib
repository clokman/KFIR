title     = "When and where did the great recession erode the support of democracy?{"}",
abstract  = "It is likely that ten years of economic crisis have eroded the support of democracy in Europe. But how much? The existing research is divided on this issue. Some claim that the degree of satisfaction with democracy has declined across the whole of Europe during the Great Recession. Other researchers have found no empirical evidence that the support of democracy as a core value has declined across Europe. They claim that merely the specific support has decreased in some countries. This article will use the data from the European Social Survey to verify both claims. It shows that the Great Recession did not lead to a legitimacy crisis of European democracies and that the diffuse support of democracy remains high in most regions. The degree to which the specific support of democracy has been weakened is moderated by the type of welfare regime. In countries where the economic crisis did strike hard and the welfare state is weakly developed, the support of democracy has dropped dramatically. This outcome takes a middle position between two extremes in the ongoing academic debate on the support of democracy. Both positions regarding the increase or decrease of support of and satisfaction with democracy are in need of more nuance by taking into account the impact of welfare regimes. Existing research often assumes a uniform European context that shows either increasing or decreasing levels of satisfaction with democracy. Our research has shown that the response of citizens to the Great Recession has been influenced by the welfare regime.",

abstract  = "Twin studies have estimated the relative contribution of genes and the environment to variance in exercise behavior and it is known that parental education positively affects exercise levels. This study investigates the role of parental education as a potential modifier of variance in exercise behavior from age 7 to 18 years. The study is based on large datasets from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR: N = 24 874 twins; surveys around the ages of 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 years) and two Finnish twin cohorts (FinnTwin12: N = 4399; 12, 14 and 17 years; FinnTwin16: N = 4648; 16, 17 and 18 years). Regular participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise activities during leisure time was assessed by survey. Parental education was dichotomized ({"}both parents with a low education{"} vs {"}at least one parent with a high education{"}). The mean in exercise behavior tended to be higher and the variance tended to be lower in children of high educated parents. Evidence for gene-by-environment interaction was weak. To develop successful interventions that specifically target children of low educated parents, the mechanisms causing the mean and variance differences between the two groups should be better understood.",

title     = "Einstein@Home Discovery of a Double Neutron Star Binary in the PALFA Survey",
abstract  = "We report here the Einstein@Home discovery of PSR J1913+1102, a 27.3 ms pulsar found in data from the ongoing Arecibo PALFA pulsar survey. The pulsar is in a 4.95 hr double neutron star (DNS) system with an eccentricity of 0.089. From radio timing with the Arecibo 305 m telescope, we measure the rate of advance of periastron to be \dot{o }=5.632(18)deg yr-1. Assuming general relativity accurately models the orbital motion, this corresponds to a total system mass of M tot = 2.875(14) {M}[?] , similar to the mass of the most massive DNS known to date, B1913+16, but with a much smaller eccentricity. The small eccentricity indicates that the second-formed neutron star (NS) (the companion of PSR J1913+1102) was born in a supernova with a very small associated kick and mass loss. In that case, this companion is likely, by analogy with other systems, to be a light (~1.2 {M}[?] ) NS; the system would then be highly asymmetric. A search for radio pulsations from the companion yielded no plausible detections, so we cannot yet confirm this mass asymmetry. By the end of 2016, timing observations should permit the detection of two additional post-Keplerian parameters: the Einstein delay (g), which will enable precise mass measurements and a verification of the possible mass asymmetry of the system, and the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves ({\dot{P}}b), which will allow another test of the radiative properties of gravity. The latter effect will cause the system to coalesce in ~0.5 Gyr.",

abstract  = "We study infinite-server queues in which the arrival process is a Cox process (or doubly stochastic Poisson process), of which the arrival rate is given by a shot-noise process. A shot-noise rate emerges naturally in cases where the arrival rate tends to exhibit sudden increases (or shots) at random epochs, after which the rate is inclined to revert to lower values. Exponential decay of the shot noise is assumed, so that the queueing systems are amenable to analysis. In particular, we perform transient analysis on the number of jobs in the queue jointly with the value of the driving shot-noise process. Additionally, we derive heavy-traffic asymptotics for the number of jobs in the system by using a linear scaling of the shot intensity. First we focus on a one-dimensional setting in which there is a single infinite-server queue, which we then extend to a network setting.",

title    = "In pursuit of lepton flavour violation: A search for the t- mgg decay with atlas at [?]s=8 TeV",
abstract = "The Standard Model describes the subatomic particles and their interactions. The latest success of this theory was reached in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, the Standard Model is not able to explain all the mysteries of our universe, such as dark matter, dark energy and the asymmetry between matter and antimatter. In addition, the observation of neutrino oscillations showed that neutrinos are massive particles and can change from one flavour (electron, muon or tau neutrino) to another. Can flavour violation be observed also among charged leptons? This would be a clear sign of physics beyond the Standard Model. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the most powerful accelerator in the world and is suitable to perform searches on charged lepton flavour violation. This thesis presents a search for the LFV t- mgg channel at the center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector, which is one of the detectors designed to study the high energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC. This channel has been analyzed here for the first time. No excess was observed with respect to the Standard Model and exclusion limits on the t-mgg branching fraction have been set on the order of 10-4. The quest for charged lepton flavour violation will continue in the coming years.",
