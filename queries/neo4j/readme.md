This directory contains Markdown files for presenting Neo4j Guides using SlideWiki. Each .md file contains the contents of exactly one slide.

**Note**: The .md files may have bad formatting with GitHub rendering. This is because headings start from level 3 (i.e., ###). This is not an issue in SlideWiki. When transferring the markdown files to SlideWiki, their raw text should be copied (i.e., not their Github rendered preview).
