This directory contains Markdown files for presenting Neo4j Guides using SlideWiki. Each .md file contains the contents of exactly one slide.

**Note**: The .md files may have bad formatting on GitHub due to their rendering by GitHub. This is because headings start from level 3 (i.e., ###), which is done in order to prevent huge texts in SlideWiki appearing too often. This does not cause a rendering issue in SlideWiki. The upshot is when transferring the markdown files to SlideWiki, their raw text should be copied (i.e., not their Github rendered preview).
