  abstract  = "This book takes a cognitive approach to the mediation ofcollective memory by works of art. In looking at cultural productionof Amerindians—the transnational mnemonic community comprisedof indígenas, originarios, mestizos, and cholos—the author arguesthat cultural memories and identity are not simply the sum totalof individuals’ expressions of self, but that some cultural artifactsbecome privileged to inform the heart of the mnemonic community.The book seeks to identify a series of cognitive schemas as thefoundation of an Amerindian Cognitive Unconsciousness as a viablealternative to the Freudian Dynamic Unconscious. Art, then, servesto trigger the cognitive schemas embedded within the Amerindiancommunity and act as the mediator of collective memory.Exploring works ranging in popularity, from Alfonso Cuarón’s Y TuMamá También to the paintings of Peruvian artists Claudia Coca andJorge Miyagui, and from Mexican Zapatistas to hip-hop, the authordetails the ways in which artists interact with the embodied memoryof the community but also assert their own place within it as crucial,furthering their audiences’ understanding of and interaction withexisting cultural schemas. In this way, the book shows that memoriesmust serve the present or they will be forgotten.",

  abstract  = "Attacks against network infrastructures can be detected by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Still reaction to these events are often limited by the lack of larger contextual information in which they occurred. In this paper we present CoreFlow, a framework for the correlation and enrichment of IDS data with network flow information. CoreFlow ingests data from the Bro IDS and augments this with flow data from the devices in the network. By doing this the network providers are able to reconstruct more precisely the route followed by the malicious flows. This enables them to devise tailored countermeasures, e.g. blocking close to the source of the attack. We tested the initial CoreFlow prototype in the ESnet network, using inputs from 3 Bro systems and more than 50 routers.",

  title     = "Nightmare Envy and Other Stories: American Culture and European Reconstruction",
  abstract  = "What has it meant to be an Americanist? What did it mean to be an Americanist through fascism, war, and occupation? Nightmare Envy and Other Stories is a study of Americanist writing and institutions in the 20th century. Four chapters trace four routes through the midcentury decades. The first is the hidden history of American Studies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The second is the strange career of {"}national character{"} in anthropology. The third is a contest between military occupation and cultural diplomacy in Europe. The fourth is the emergence and fate of the {"}American Renaissance,{"} as the scholar and literary critic F.O. Matthiessen carried a canon of radical literature across the Iron Curtain. Each chapter culminates in the postwar period, when the ruin of postwar Europe led writers and intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic to understand America in new ways. Many of our modern myths of the United States and Europe were formed in this moment. Some saw the United States assume the mantle of cultural redeemer. Others saw a stereotypical America, rich in civilization but poor in culture, overtake a stereotypical Europe, rich in culture and equally rich in disaster. Drawing on American and European archives, the book weaves cultural, intellectual, and diplomatic history, with portraits of Matthiessen, Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, David Riesman, Alfred Kazin, and Ralph Ellison. It excavates the history of the Salzburg Seminar in American Civilization, where displaced persons, former Nazis, budding Communists, and glad-handing Americans met on the common ground of American culture. Others found keys to their own contexts in American books, reading Moby-Dick in the ruins. Nightmare Envy and Other Stories chronicles American encounters with European disaster, European encounters with American fiction, and the chasms over which culture had to reach.",

  abstract  = "The Contestado War occurred in the southern region of Brazil between 1912 and 1916, opposing the local population, known as sertaneja or cabocla, against the state and federal military forces. It was triggered by the construction of railroads and the expansion of commercial logging activity. These early capitalist enterprises threatened natural habitats and led to the imprisonment or displacement of local communities.The displaced population congregated in so called ‘holy strongholds’, new villages which were rigidly controlled by the church in remote or relatively inaccessible locations. In 3 years of terror from 1912 until the end of 1915, state and federal military forces attempted to systematically destroy these new settlements. It has been estimated that as many as 6,000 people died in the conflict, mostly local caboclos. After the war, public agents tried to resolve the territorial disputes in the States of Santa Catarina and Paraná through a process of social engineering. Colonization companies were set up to attract European immigrants to settle the land. This process served to further marginalize the remaining local population, who had already been worn down by the years of conflict and disruption. The area remains one of the poorest and economically disadvantaged regions of southern Brazil to this day. We offer our reflections on this subject below, with an emphasis on the post-conflict history of the territory, and the ways in which a programme of public archaeology has been devised to explore and disseminate information about this painful past.",

  abstract  = "Firms increasingly use social network sites to reach out to customers and proactively intervene with observed consumer messages. Despite intentions to enhance customer satisfaction by extending customer service, sometimes these interventions are received negatively by consumers. We draw on privacy regulation theory to theorize how proactive customer service interventions with consumer messages on social network sites may evoke feelings of privacy infringement. Subsequently we use privacy calculus theory to propose how these perceptions of privacy infringement, together with the perceived usefulness of the intervention, in turn drive customer satisfaction. In two experiments, we find that feelings of privacy infringement associated with proactive interventions may explain why only reactive interventions enhance customer satisfaction. Moreover, we find that customer satisfaction can be modelled through the calculus of the perceived usefulness and feelings of privacy infringement associated with an intervention. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of privacy concerns on consumer behavior in the context of firm-consumer interactions on social network sites, extend the applicability of privacy calculus theory, and contribute to complaint and compliment management literature. To practitioners, our findings demonstrate that feelings of privacy are an element to consider when handling consumer messages on social media, but also that privacy concerns may be overcome if an intervention is perceived as useful enough.",

  abstract  = "This paper examines the allure of ancient athletics by examining its disappearance in Late Antiquity. Focusing on the spectator experience at the athletic games, the paper argues that the elites of the ancient cities, on whose investments athletic education and competitions depended, started to look at athletic contests in new ways. They may still have imagined themselves as successful athletes during the excitement of the contest, but they stopped identifying the athletes on display as their peers. As athletics, and the competitive spirit connected to it, lost its role in the education of the lower layers of the ruling classes, many spectators no longer had personal experience with the different sports and were, therefore, no longer potential athletes themselves. The spectators moreover stopped associating athletics with moral virtues: striving for physical excellence gradually became regarded as a vain pursuit, contradictory to the Christian ideal of humility. The perception of the athletic competition gradually shifted from an exemplary ‘contest’ to an exciting, but potentially dangerous ‘show’.",

These organizations represent diverse, complex, and frequently atypical contexts. We contend that these contexts are especially enthralling for accounting scholars given their performance measurement challenges, accountability to diverse sets of stakeholders, and the need to frequently balance and reconcile logics of efficiency and effectiveness. To support our contentions, we unpack a number of distinct control and accountability-related themes underlying the four papers included in this Special Issue. We reflect on how these themes offer future empirical and theoretical research directions for accounting and accountability research in the realm of NGO/non-profit organizations and in organizations more generally.",

  abstract = "Deep models are the defacto standard in visual decision problems due to their impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. On the other hand, their opaqueness has led to a surge of interest in explainable systems. In this work, we emphasize the importance of model explanation in various forms such as visual pointing and textual justification. The lack of data with justification annotations is one of the bottlenecks of generating multimodal explanations. Thus, we propose two large-scale datasets with annotations that visually and textually justify a classification decision for various activities, i.e. ACT-X, and for question answering, i.e. VQA-X. We also introduce a multimodal methodology for generating visual and textual explanations simultaneously. We quantitatively show that training with the textual explanations not only yields better textual justification models, but also models that better localize the evidence that support their decision.",

Specifically, we introduce a phrase-critic model to refine (re-score/re-rank) generated candidate explanations and employ a relative-attribute inspired ranking loss using {"}flipped{"} phrases as negative examples for training. At test time, our phrase-critic model takes an image and a candidate explanation as input and outputs a score indicating how well the candidate explanation is grounded in the image.",

User acceptance is likely to benefit from easy-to-interpret visual and textual driving rationales which allow end-users to understand what triggered a particular behavior. Our approach involves two stages. In the first stage, we use visual (spatial) attention model to train a convolutional network end-to-end from images to steering angle commands. The attention model identifies image regions that potentially influence the network's output. We then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions causally influence the vehicle's control signal. In the second stage, we use a video-to-text language model to produce textual rationales that justify the model's decision. The explanation generator uses a spatiotemporal attention mechanism, which is encouraged to match the controller's attention.",

  abstract  = "Chemical analysis of raw wastewater in order to assess the presence of biological markers entering a wastewater treatment plant can provide objective information about the health and lifestyle of the population connected to the sewer system. This work was performed in a tropical country of Central America, Costa Rica, with the aim of extending this knowledge to new world regions. This work is the first to report wastewater-based epidemiological data on the use of illicit drugs in this region of the world. Composite wastewater samples from the influents of two different wastewater treatment facilities and surface water samples from surrounding areas were collected applying the best practice protocol and analysed to investigate the occurrence and fate of selected illicit drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Results showed the presence of chemical indicators of the classic drugs cocaine and cannabis at high concentration levels, besides the moderate presence of the opiates codeine and morphine. Neither the worldwide commonly used psychoactive substances of abuse such as synthetic phenethylamines, nor pharmaceuticals from the family of benzodiazepines were detected, demonstrating the spatial differences in drug use among different world regions. In addition, effluent wastewater samples were analysed and compared to influent concentrations in order to evaluate the decrease in concentration of the targeted analytes through two treatment technologies. As a final step, a wide-scope qualitative screening, including hundreds of suspect compounds, was applied in order to have a better knowledge on the presence of pharmaceuticals in waters and to assess the potential impact of the treated wastewater into the receiving aquatic ecosystems.",

  abstract  = "We compared clinically referred children with anxiety disorders (AD; n = 63) to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n = 39), ADHD Combined (ADHD-C; n = 62), ADHD Predominantly Inattentive (ADHD-I; n = 64), and typically developing children ( n = 42) on child quality of life (QOL), paternal and maternal psychopathology and parental stress. Diagnoses were based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Multilevel analyses showed that QOL in AD was higher on school and social functioning, compared to respectively ADHD and ASD, and lower compared to normal controls on all five domains. Fathers reported their AD children higher QOL than mothers. Also, AD appeared to be associated with less parental stress and parental psychopathology than other child psychopathology. Therefore, parental factors may need to be considered more in treatment of children with ADHD/ASD than AD.",

  abstract  = "The admission and geographic distribution of asylum seekers has a central place in public discourse in Western countries, amid mounting asylum applications and dire humanitarian crises. Receiving countries usually distribute the newly arriving asylum seekers across the entire country, in particular for small remote communities. Incidental opposition actions by local residents against the siting of Asylum Seeker Centres (ASC) has created the perception of strong and widespread resistance in the public sphere. This article aims to assess this alleged backlash by examining attitudes toward asylum seekers in small local communities. Using data from three representative surveys conducted among residents in the vicinity of four ASCs in the Netherlands, the regression analysis shows a strikingly high willingness to host an ASC, in opposition to popularly assumed public opinion.",

  abstract  = "Counselor competence in telephone Motivation Interviewing (MI) to change lifestyle behaviors in a primary care population was assessed using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) rating system. Counselor behavior was evaluated by trained raters. Twenty minutes of a random sample of 336 MI sessions were coded representing 232 counselees. Ninety-four sessions (28%) were double coded to assess inter-rater agreement. The MI fidelity was examined by comparing the MI fidelity scores direction, empathy, spirit, % open questions, % complex reflections, reflections-to-questions ratio, % MI-adherent responses with the matching beginner proficiency MITI threshold.The inter-rater agreements for the MI fidelity summary scores were good (spirit, reflections-to-questions ratio), fair (empathy, % open questions, % MI-adherent responses) or poor (direction, % complex reflection). The MI fidelity scores for direction, empathy, spirit and the percentage of complex reflections exceeded the MITI threshold, but lower scores were found for the percentage of open questions, the reflections-to-questions ratio and the percentage of MI-adherent responses.In conclusion, evidence that MI was implemented was revealed. However, the inter-rater agreements scores and some fidelity scores leave room for improvement indicating that raters and counselors may need more ongoing training and feedback to achieve and maintain adequate competence. These findings apply to more complex skills (as rating complex reflections) in particular.",

  abstract  = "There is consensus in the literature that policymaking in the United States (US) and Europe generates different lobbying styles. Two explanations for these differences have been developed so far. The first posits that distinct lobbying styles reflect different political cultures. The second attributes distinct lobbying styles to variation in the institutional context in which lobbyists operate. Studies that have analysed lobbying within the US and Europe and assessed the relative importance of these arguments are problematic because both explanations are consistent with observed differences in lobbying style. In this article, we circumvent problems of observational equivalence by focussing on European and American lobbyists who are active in a similar institutional venue – that is, international diplomatic conferences. Relying on evidence collected at World Trade Organization Ministerial Conferences and United Nation Climate Summits, we tested the relevance of alternative explanations for the variation in lobbying styles between European and American lobbyists. Our results give robust support to the institutional argument.",

  title     = "Gender Differences in Resistance to Schooling: The Role of Dynamic Peer-Influence and Selection Processes",
  abstract  = "Boys engage in notably higher levels of resistance to schooling than girls. While scholars argue that peer processes contribute to this gender gap, this claim has not been tested with longitudinal quantitative data. This study fills this lacuna by examining the role of dynamic peer-selection and influence processes in the gender gap in resistance to schooling (i.e., arguing with teachers, skipping class, not putting effort into school, receiving punishments at school, and coming late to class) with two-wave panel data. We expect that, compared to girls, boys are more exposed and more responsive to peers who exhibit resistant behavior. We estimate hybrid models on 5448 students from 251 school classes in Sweden (14–15 years, 49% boys), and stochastic actor-based models (SIENA) on a subsample of these data (2480 students in 98 classes; 49% boys). We find that boys are more exposed to resistant friends than girls, and that adolescents are influenced by the resistant behavior of friends. These peer processes do not contribute to a widening of the gender gap in resistance to schooling, yet they contribute somewhat to the persistence of the initial gender gap. Boys are not more responsive to the resistant behavior of friends than girls. Instead, girls are influenced more by the resistant behavior of lower status friends than boys. This explains to some extent why boys increase their resistance to schooling more over time. All in all, peer-influence and selection processes seem to play a minor role in gender differences in resistance to schooling. These findings nuance under investigated claims that have been made in the literature.",
